<p>I've got to say that I generally disagree with your choices here. The main saving grace is that your choice of No. 1 naff Transformer is probably correct. I know you've got a car thing going on here but some of the Transformers you list were great characters which surely offsets the things that let the toy down.</p>
<p>My main objection is that you are slagging off a lot of the Transformers that were the main characters in the original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/">1986 Transformers the Movie</a> that I think completely rocked!  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">The 2007 version</a> isn't bad but has nowhere near the story or scale of the original move. Give me <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000080/">Orson Welles</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000555/">Judd Nelson</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000559/">Leonard Nimoy</a> and<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919798/"> Frank Welker</a> (plus <a title="Peter Cullen" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191520/">the obvious</a>) any day of the week. Give me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicron">Unicron</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybertron">Cybertron</a>, Cybertron's moons, Earth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkion">The Planet of Junk</a> and two massive battles! Wow, I'm going to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000P28A32?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B000P28A32">get the DVD</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=philleggsoftc-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000P28A32" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> out after this.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_149" align="alignnone" width="198" caption="Transformers: The Movie - 1986 poster"]<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000P28A32?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B000P28A32"><img class="size-medium wp-image-149" title="Transformers: The Movie" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/041_24_055transformers-posters-198x300.jpg" alt="Transformers: The Movie - 1986 poster" width="198" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Anyway: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurr">Blurr</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcee">Arcee</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kup">Kup </a>(who doesn't get a mention - good), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Rod_(Transformers)">Hot Rod</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodimus">Rodimus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_(Transformers)">Springer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> were a new group of Autobots who were main characters in that great movie. Ok, Blurr is a bit annoying, but isn't that just because the guy doing his voice (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001079/"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Scatman Crothers</span></a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608321/">John Moschitta Jr.</a>) just repeated the same line over and over again. That's not Blurr's fault, it's the fault of the guy who write the script. The toy may have been crap, I don't know. Ok, I'll give you Blurr too.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=1]</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> - the toy does look pretty pants! In the movie he transports the defeated Decepticons back to Cybertron and needs to "jettison weight", whereby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream">Starscream</a> gets rid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron">Megatron</a> and we gain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvatron">Galvatron</a>. So, he has his purpose. I can only assume that the toy was that terrible that for you it justifies the No.8 slot.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundwave_(Transformer)">Soundwave</a> - What planet are you on? Soundwave is a great Transformer. He was there at the very beginning. He is a vital part of a majority of the Transformers stories. And... And.. And he can eject other small Transformers out of his chest. That's Awesome! "Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, Ramjet eject!" The toy wasn't bad either. If I remember correctly you could get small cassette transformers (mentioned in the quote) and put them inside his cassette deck. No, he's not a car but he was a great Transformer. You're just plain wrong with this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodimus">Rodimus Prime</a> - Have you ever seen Transformers the Movie?!? "This is the end of the road Galvatron". He even gets to say Prime's quote of "Autobots, transform and roll out" and it works. He also has a pivotal roll in bringing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime">Optimus Prime</a> back to life in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194172/">The Return of Optimus Prime</a> (brought back to life, eventually, by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessons">Quintesson</a>.....). So, NO, he's not one of the worst Transformers ever (but his toy did look a bit like a mobile home, hmmm).</p>
<p><object width="480" height="295" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/6ByNT12IYbY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6ByNT12IYbY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-Gar">Wreck-Gar</a> - Again, the toy may have been rubbish but that doesn't mean he was one of the worst Transformers ever. He is the leader of the Planet of Junk/the Junkions. As you mentioned, he was voiced by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001385/">Eric Idle</a>, which IS cool. If his arms fall out he can just stick them back in again with some special blue glue (using his legs?). Now that's cool, not crap.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_transformers">Bumblebee</a> A.K.A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbug_(Transformers)">Goldbug</a> - He wants to be friends with people so he's rubbish? What? He's one of the first Transformers and deserves to avoid this list on that fact alone. You just can't put any of the Transformers that were on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_(Transformers)">Ark</a>, which crash landed on earth with Prime, in the list. Period. Oh, and he's a VW Gold...</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_(Transformers)">Jazz</a> - How can anybody say that Jazz is one of the Worst Transformers ever? Jazz wasn't the best in the new movie but they got the character wrong. Jazz has been in Transformers since I can remember and killing him off was just wrong. His toy WAS great. It was one of the first Transformer toys to be made and wasn't all plastic like the more recent ones.  He was on the Ark AND he's a Porsche.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=2]</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> - Firstly his toy was actually pretty cool. He could fire rockets. He was bigger than Prime. His cab was exactly the same as Prime's and Prime was a great toy. He "couldn't take over the leadership when the driving drumstick (Rodimus Prime) was in charge" What? Do you mean that he couldn't open the matrix of leadership after Prime had been killed because it wasn't their "darkest hour"? I got an Ultra Magnus one Christmas and my parents still speak to me, and I've just double-checked, like me. You ain't justifying this one buddy! I think he gets a bad rap - leave him alone.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_144" align="alignnone" width="120" caption="Ultra Magnus - Now, light our darkest hour"]<img class="size-full wp-image-144" title="Ultra Magnus - Now, light our darkest hour" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ultramagnus.gif" alt="Ultra Magnus - Now, light our darkest hour" width="120" height="90" />[/caption]</p>
<p>So, I'll give you Arcee, Blurr and, at a push, Astrotrain. Personally, I'd list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelie_(Transformers)">Wheelie</a> and any of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticons">Insecticons</a>. I'm also surprised that the non-car <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinobots">Dinobots</a> didn't get a mention.</p>
<p>Nice opinion-provoking post.</p>
<p>Til all are one!</p>
