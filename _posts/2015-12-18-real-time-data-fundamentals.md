excerpt: "There are lots of real-time frameworks which exist to allow us to build real-time features and functionality into our apps. However, I often see developers who are excited about discovering real-time framework X and then proclaim *now to find a use for it*. Every single application has real-time data and every single application could benefit from real-time feature driven by that data.

So I felt compelled to write a series of posts."

There are [lots of real-time frameworks](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/) which exist to allow us to build real-time features and functionality into our apps. However, I often see developers who are excited about discovering real-time framework X and then proclaim "now to find a use for it". Every single application has real-time data and every single application could benefit from real-time features driven by that data.

So I felt compelled to write a series of posts over on the Pusher blog covering some of the fundamentals of real-time. This is complimentary with the series I previously wrote on [choosing your real-time web app tech stack](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/12/09/choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html). If anything, this new series should be read first.

1. [What is real-time](https://blog.pusher.com/what-is-real-time/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=realtime_data) - understanding what "real-time" means in the context of web, mobile and IoT applications
2. [Discovering the Real-Time Data in Your Apps](https://blog.pusher.com/real-time-data-discovery-in-your-apps/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=realtime_data) - helping you identify where you can find the real-time data in your apps and systems
3. [Using Your Real-Time Data: Use Cases & Features](https://blog.pusher.com/using-your-real-time-data-features/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=realtime_data)
4. [How to Describe, Publish & Consume Real-Time Data
](https://blog.pusher.com/how-to-describe-publish-consume-real-time-data/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=realtime_data) - how to easily share the data you've found and consume it within your applications in order to build real-time features

I'm really pleased by this series of posts. I believe they cover some of the fundamentals that have been missing up until now. Every application does have real-time data and with that data you can then build features such as real-time notifications, activity streams, data visualisations, dashboards, interactive communication features such as chat, multi-user collaboration or even expose the data via a [real-time API](https://blog.pusher.com/5-reasons-you-should-have-a-real-time-api/).

I'd love to hear your feedback on this real-time fundamentals series. So don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=real-time data series).
