**So, you want a real-time API. Where do you start?**

You're convinced of the benefits of a real-time API and know what data you want to make available through it. But you've probably got a number of questions playing on your mind:

* What method do I use to expose the data? 
* Do I increase the allowed polling interval of my REST API? (*Please don't*) or offer HTTP Long-Polling, HTTP Streaming and/or WebSocket API endpoints?
* Or should I offer WebHooks?
* What format should my data be in?
* Are there any tools like [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/), [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) or [RAML](http://raml.org/) for real-time to help?
* Are there any real-time frameworks built with APIs in mind?
* And how do I go about scaling a real-time API?

In this talk I gave at API Strat Berlin as part of the [Architecture, Scalability, and Microservices](http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/sessions/architecture-microservices/) session, I hope you'll have a much clearer picture of where to start when building your real-time API.
