<p>I think that <a title="Live Mesh" href="http://www.mesh.com">Live Mesh</a> will be really useful. I think it provides great benefit to individual users, such as myself, and has great potential to be used by <a title="Independent Software Solutions" href="http://independentsoftwaresolutions.com">software solution developers</a>. I'm presently using it to synchronise some files that I want to backup and be available wherever I am.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/livemesh.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-64" title="Live Mesh" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/livemesh-300x214.png" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>I originally had a lot of web files being synchronised, around 700MB, but the synchronisation was taking ages and killing my CPU. CPU was sitting at 100% and there was no sign of things completing. I think it was having a problem with the volume of small files.</p>
<p>To summarise: it's a great product with bags of potential but something needs to be done to reduce the CPU usage when dealing with the synchronisation of a large volume of small files.</p>
