{% include about.html %} From 2016 to 2020 I had the pleasure of supporting,
enabling and growing a Developer Relations and Platform Experience team at
<a href="https://developer.nexmo.com">Nexmo</a> (acquired by Vonage). We grew a
team from 3 people to 42, and the team continues to move from strength to
strength following my departure. We built a diverse, collaborative,
multi-functional, remote-first team spread from San Francisco to Singapore. A
team that:

- Won the very first "Best Overall Developer Relations Programme Award" in 2018
- Won 5 awards for documentation across 2018 and 2019
- Raised awareness in targeted developer communities from 0% to 30%
- Increased monthly developer blog post traffic by over 1000% and climbing
- Championed and executed on a new self-serve developer onboarding flow that saw
  the number of developers that experience our APIs increase by 200%
- Responsible for a $3.5M budget and $6M+ self-serve revenue. 40%+ of all
  business revenue ($400M+ in 2020) began as self-serve.
- â€¦and more

Prior to joining Nexmo, I was Head of Developer Relations at
<a href="https://pusher.com">Pusher</a> where I wrote documentation, built SDKs,
handled support, met customers, frequently wrote articles, and gave talks on
<a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide">Realtime
Web Technologies</a> and general Web technology.

I'm the technical editor of the book
[Developer Relations - How to build and grow a successful developer program](https://www.devrelbook.com/),
a contributor to the book
[HTML5 Hacks](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/html5-hacks/9781449335052/),
and the co-author of the APress for-beginners title
"<a href="http://realtimewebapps.com">Realtime Web Apps</a>".

I live near Dollar, Clackmannanshire in Scotland.
