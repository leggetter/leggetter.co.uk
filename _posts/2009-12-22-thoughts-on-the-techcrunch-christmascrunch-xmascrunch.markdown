<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/06/techcrunch-europe-christmascrunch-its-a-realtime-holiday/">TechCrunch ChristmasCrunch</a> which came with the tagline “It’s a realtime holiday”. It’s great to see so many companies embracing the real-time web and building their businesses around it. Some companies that you would still class as start-ups such as <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>, <a href="http://seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> and <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/">tweetmeme</a> are now relatively established and there were a dozen or more startup pitches with the majority of these new companies focusing on the real-time web.</p>
<p>There’s so much data being generated by social networks that it wasn’t surprising that a lot of the focus was around analysing the data. The key words from the event in relation to the data were <strong>relevance</strong>, <strong>sentiment</strong>, <strong>curation</strong>, <strong>authority</strong> and <strong>location</strong>. All of these terms play off each other. <strong>Relevance</strong> can be determined by authority and location. <strong>Sentiment</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>authority</strong> can be determined by a curation process. Some solutions to curation pitched at the event were based on language and text analysis, whilst others suggested crowdsourcing and using manual intervention as a means of determining the quality of data.<br />

Of all the presentations, panels and startup pitches there was not all that much time spent talking about underlying technology used by any of the companies. <a href="http://jameswhittaker.co.uk/">James Whittaker</a> of TweetDeck reiterated <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2834854">Iain Dodsworths words from Le Web</a> in saying TweetDeck would stay with the Adobe Air platform. He also mentioned that they were looking forward to the version 2.0 release of Air – I wish I’d asked why. <a href="http://twitter.com/Marco">Marco Kaiser</a> of Seesmic, in my eyes TweetDeck’s main rival, talked about moving to the Windows platform to increase application performance and provide a plugin development framework. Other than that the only other mention of technology that I can remember were a couple of mentions of PUSH by David Maher Roberts of <a href="http://www.thefilter.com/">The Filter</a>, who said none of their clients were using PUSH at the moment but there were requests in place and a POC ongoing, and <a href="http://twitter.com/thetimmorgan">Tim Morgan</a> of <a href="http://mintdigital.com/">Mint Digital</a> who have recently released <a href="http://football3s.com/">Football3’s</a> which clearly relies on true real-time in order to be interactive.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting event and I’m really pleased that I attended but I would really have liked to have gained some insight into the technologies that companies are using and would have liked to see people talking about and moving to “real-time” in the true sense of the term rather than it being used as a marketing term.</p>
<p>You can view <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/12/16/xmascrunch-speakers-and-pitches-in-video/">videos of most of the presentations on TechCrunch</a>. Look out for one lady finding it particularly funny when I went to ask Marco of Seesmic a question and introduced myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi, I'm Phil Leggetter and I'm a Real-Time Web Software Consultant... I just made that up!
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a joke, I really am a "Real-Time Web Software Consultant", but I thought it might be quite funny, but not THAT funny. You can see this at just after 7:00 on this video:<br />
