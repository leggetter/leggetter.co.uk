<p>Just listening to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.socialmediawhitenoise.com/">Social Media White Noise</a> podcast and really enjoying it.<br />
I got distracted by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foursquare-api/browse_thread/thread/1a1683954077caab">something else</a> and then tuned back into the podcast. They were talking about taking digital media consumption away from the computer, which really interests me, and I wanted to jump back to the start of that part of the podcast. I couldn't.</p>

<p>Is there a podcast player that lets the podcast author define time slices that cover certain topics? Can this be published as part of the RSS feed so all MP3/Podcast players can use this information?</p>
