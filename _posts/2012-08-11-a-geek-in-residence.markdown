excerpt: "I can't believe it! I left University to take my first job 11 years ago. During that time I've worked in finance, e-learning, GIS and SEO/digital marketing. Although I've had some interest in these sectors my real interest was just the technology, with a passion for realtime web technologies. I now work for Pusher and can focus almost entirely on realtime web technologies and the application of them. Whilst I'm truly lucky to be able to work day-in day-out on something I'm passionate about, it's always a good idea to gain exposure to new things. New experiences exercise the mind and you never know when those experiences will help with what you normally do."

<p>I can't believe it! I left University to take my first job 11 years ago. During that time I've worked in finance, e-learning, GIS and SEO/digital marketing. Although I've had some interest in these sectors my real interest was just the technology, with a passion for realtime web technologies. I now work for Pusher and can focus almost entirely on realtime web technologies and the application of them. Whilst I'm truly lucky to be able to work day-in day-out on something I'm passionate about, it's always a good idea to gain exposure to new things. New experiences exercise the mind and you never know when those experiences will help with what you normally do.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2012/5/3/shakey-has-it-all-realtime-mobile-browser-and-user-audience-engagement">attending Culture Hack Scotland</a> my eyes were opened to a new experience; the focus was still technology, but used in innovate and experimental ways with a focus on 'culture'.</p>
<h2>Uncultured Me</h2>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the most 'cultured' of individuals. I don't tend to go to musical or theatrical events, art galleries or museums - unless it's to see Dinosaur skeletons; my wife would undoubtedly mention the fact that about 100 of the 150 photos we took whilst in New York a few years ago are of dino bones. I've been to the Tate Modern once and all I can remember from the trip was an upside-down piano and a video of some guy hitting himself where it hurts whilst wearing boxing gloves. I really like going to the cinema, but I only tend to go to watch comedies or blockbusters.</p>
<p>So, how and why have I ended up as a <a href="http://www.welcometosync.com/geeks/">Geek-in-Residence</a> for Sync, "a two year prototyping and innovation programme for the cultural sector in Scotland."?</p>
<h2>Exercise the mind</h2>
<p>As I said in the introduction, new experiences exercise the mind. But, I'm also aware that my lack of culture isn't actually something to boast about. It's something I want to change and I felt the Geeks-in-Residence programme represented a perfect opportunity for me to use my existing development skills and at the same time give me some exposure to areas that I generally wouldn't be otherwise.</p>
<p>I applied to for a position as geek on the <a href="http://macrobert.org">MacRobert</a> project, a project with an initial focus on engaging with students before, during and after events. There were a few reasons why this project was of interest to me.</p>
<ol>
<li>MacRoberts is an Art centre. What better place to get cultured.</li>
<li>I believe that realtime web technologies will play a massive part in the future of the web. They allow interactive and engaging applications to be built and this matched well with the project outline.</li>
<li>I went to the University of Stirling. Although MacRobert is it's own entity it is still in the heart of the university so I'm hopeful that I can do something to have a positive impact on the university. Back to where I was 11 years ago!</li>
<li>I live very near to Stirling University. It's just handy/ideal!</li>
</ol>
<p>I put something like this on my application form. It must have worked...</p>
<h2>I got in!</h2>
<p>A bit like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQj_tcQ2Ey8">Kevin Flynn entering the grid</a>, I was very excited that, after an interview with <a href="http://twitter.com/beyongolia">Erin Mcguire</a>, I was asked to take on a Geek-in-Residence on the MacRobert project.</p>
<p>I was also really excited to hear that I'd be working with <a href="http://andyyoungdesign.wordpress.com/">Andy Young</a> of <a href="http://wearesnook.com/snook/">Snook</a>. Andy is a products and services designer so I'm undoubtedly going to learn a bunch of stuff from him. Well, I already have, but I'll save that for another post.</p>
