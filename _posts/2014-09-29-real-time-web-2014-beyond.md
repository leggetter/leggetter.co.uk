Itâ€™s interesting how I used to always talk about the <strong>Real-time Web</strong> and <strong>Real-time Web Apps</strong> but now it really does need to be **Real-time Internet Apps** because **IoT (The Internet of Things)** now means we need to think beyond what we would traditionally class as Internet technologies. In this latest talk I cover realtime web technology communication paradigms and use cases for 2014 and beyond.

I also talk through the technology stack we have to build upon when trying to be innovative and that the new technologies we have now give us the opportunity to innovate sooner than ever before.

## Talk

You can view a recorded version of the talk below which I made as I was supposed to give the talk at another event but my car broke down and this was the only way I could still fulfil my commitment.
