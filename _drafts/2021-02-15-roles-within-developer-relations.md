title: The Roles Within Developer Relations
excerpt: 

---

[Developer Relations](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html) continues to evolve and with that comes specialisation. That specialisation results in different perspectives on what it is to "do Developer Relations", new role definitions and job titles. In this post, I'll share my experience and observations on the roles that are most commonly seen and will provide my take on the definition of them.

Before I begin, I'll state, as I have before, that a job title doesn't wholly reflect a role. Nor, if we're honest, will a more detailed job specification fully encapsulate everything that a person ever does within a role. But, a role and job title should indicate what someone taking on a role should be focusing on.

## Roles Overview

Let's start by listing out the roles I'm going to cover:

| **Role**                                                        | **Hits on Google**   |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| [Community Manager](#community-manager)                         | 26,000,000           |
| [Developer Advocate](#developer-advocate)                       | 736,000              |
| [Developer Educator](#developer-educator)                       | 241,000              |
| [Developer Evangelist](#developer-evangelist)                   | 168,000              |
| [Developer Relations Engineer](#developer-relations-engineer)   | 26,000               |
| [Developer Experience Engineer](#developer-experience-engineer) | 18,900               |

Straight away you may be as surprised as I am to see that "Developer Advocate" is a term that's more popular - or at least visible to Google - than "Developer Evangelist". I've seen the term "Developer Evangelist" used less and less over the years with many prefering to choose the advocacy title. But for "Developer Educator" to now have more results than "Developer Evangelist" is very surprising.

"Community Manager" has 26 Million results. This isn't surprising since this role is used outside of Developer Relations as well as being a key role within it.

Both "Developer Experience Engineer" and "Developer Relations Engineer" have very few results in comparison to the others. I believe we're going to see a significant increase in the demand for experienced focused roles over the coming years.
