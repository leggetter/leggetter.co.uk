<p><strong>Realtime location tracking</strong> Poll (I'm sure they'll introduce WebHooks soon) the Vodafone API and push realtime updates to a map.</p>
<p><strong>A better Betfair</strong> Ok, you probably won't be able to build an app that's better than betfair. But  using our API in conjunction with Betfair you'll be able to build a realtime betting system. The questions is: can you get realtime data from Betfair? Things like realtime odds?</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Hangman</strong> A simple turn-based game. Take the ideas that Dan from Pearson spoke about and use Pusher to push those results to multiple users.</p>
<p><strong>Realtime context sensitive advertising</strong> Advertising tends to be pretty static once an application loads. Why not analyse how a user is using an application and dynamically push different adverts to their appâ€¦ using Pusher :)</p>
<p>Any questions please give me a shout. I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a> on Twitter.</p>
