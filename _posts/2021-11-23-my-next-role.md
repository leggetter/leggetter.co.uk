Over the next few weeks or months, as I search for my next role, I'm hoping that I'm going to have a few conversations. The purpose of this post is to clarify what I can bring to any company that is considering employing me and what I'm looking for in my next role.

## What I'll Bring

I hope that [my experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leggetter/) speaks for itself, but here are some specific things that are relevant to my search for a new role right now.

### A Product-First Approach

I have a background in software engineering so I am a developer and understand what developers need and care about. You have to start with a product that solves a real problem and provides a really good developer experience.

I stand by this. And, in some cases, the experience of the product itself is a fundamental way of raising developer awareness. Stripe is a great example of this. Of course, in most cases you also need to directly raise awareness but the developer experience and have an amplifying effect that has to be prioritised.

Inherent in this is that I'm product-minded and feel I can bring value by either being accountable for key product assets (API standards/design, documentation, other educational assets, sample code, SDKs, and developer consoles or dashboards) or, at a minimum, a key stakeholder. Therefore, I don't want a role purely focused on marketing activities. This doesn't mean I'm against a role within marketing but that Marketing department would have to be strongly aligned with Product.

### Business Understanding & Strategy

I've worked with C-level executives for many years. At Vonage, a public company, I reported directly to the CPO following acquisition and contributed to slide decks for the board and market analysts. I understand that there are sometimes competing forces at play and know when to find alternative solutions, compromise, or pick a battle.

I understand the difference between strategy and tactics (and I've got a certificate to prove it). I can take high-level business objectives and create a strategy to help the business meet those objectives through developer-focused initiatives.

## How I'll Assess the Company

The main assessment criteria I have (and I have a spreadsheet) are as follows:

### Be Inclusive & Diverse

I want to work for a company that is understands, accepts, and values differences between people including those:

• Of different races, ethnicities, genders, ages, religions, disabilities, and sexual orientations
• With differences in education, personalities, skill sets, experiences, and knowledge bases

The workforce must either already be diverse or a **very** clear programme is in place to increase diversity.

### Be Developer-Focused

I'm a developer at heart and I love to enable other developers. So I want to join a developer-focused company. I've previously worked for companies that build products for developers but where many of the people within that company need to be convinced time and time again about the value of developers. This can also lead to decisions being made without considering for software developers; even those that work at the company.

So, If the company doesn't fundamentally understand developers I'll need a C-level role where I can be the voice of the developer within a company so I don't have to spend as much time "managing up".

No matter the type of company, I really want my focus to be enabling a team to serve developers instead of "managing up".

### Have an Exciting Product

I've learned that it's important to me to be excited about the products that the company I work for is building. In the past the products for companies I've most enjoyed working with are:

- Real-time web techologies
- An open-source tooklit for building complex JavaScript apps
- APIs for communications such as messaging, voice, and video
- Open-source product analytics including funnels and feature flags

I'm not as intersted in roles focused on developer infrastructure such as k8s and source control. These are really powerful and important products but just not something that excites me as much as those listed above.

### Be Transparent

The most transparent company I've every worked for is PostHog and I'd like to find a company with a similar level of transparency. An example of this is the [PostHog company handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook). But it goes beyond that with the executive team minutes being shared each week and the board slides shared after each meeting.

## What I Want from a Role

My current priorities for my next role are:

### Developer Experience & Relations

I've already stated that I'm product-minded, why I feel that benefits a business and that I don't want to be purely focused on marketing to developers. This will rule me out of some roles and that's okay.

I'd like to be responsible for key assets of a developer's experience with a company brand and product. At Vonage I was ultimately accountable for all developer touch points of the Vonage API platform (Nexmo and Tokbox) with the exception of paid advertsing. This enabled the team to think holistically about the experience we were providing to developers.

I'm looking for a similar opportunity where I am accountable for many of the developer touch points across product and marketing. Where I'm not accountable I'd want to be consulted at the very least.

### An Opportunity to Learn & Grow

My biggest challenge and learning experience was growing a DevRel team of three people to become a a Platform & Developer Experience team of fourty-two people. This was a diverse, collaborative, multi-functional, remote-first team spread from San Francisco to Singapore, with a multi-million dollar budget and multi-million dollar revenue goal.

During that period I was on the Nexmo SLT (Senior Leadership Team) and then the API Core Council (an exec team representing the API group within Vonage). In these teams I acted as the voice of the developer and gained a lot of insight into how businesses operate.

I'd like to build upon these experiences which means a role such as Chief Developer Relations/Developer Experience Officer would be perfect. However, these roles are few and far between so a VP-level role that reports directly to a C-level executive would also give me the access I feel I need to learn, grow, and help a team and business be successful.

### Servant Leadership & Team Building

I enjoy helping others succeed. I believe the traditional company org chart should be inverted where the CEO's role is to support and enable everyone above them. Therefore, my role as a leader within such an organisation will be to grow, support and enable a department or team.

I want to work as part of a dedicated team or function. I'm not a standalone individual contributor (IC) though I can be an IC on a team as well as lead it.

I don't want to work at a company where the role of a leader is to tell a team what to do. And I don't want my manager to tell me what to do. I want to be given challenges and problems to solve, and to be enabled and trusted to execute.

### To Directly Help the Business Succeed

I'm a servant leader because I inherently enjoy helping others succeed. This doesn't mean only helping those I'm asked to support and enable (manage/lead) but also anyone that I report to. I want to help make them and the business successful.

In order to do this there must be a clear understanding of how I can bring or enable value.
