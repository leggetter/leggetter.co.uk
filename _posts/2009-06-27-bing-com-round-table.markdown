<p>On Monday between 19:00 and 21:00 I'm going to a <a title="Bing.com" href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> roundtable (round table) in London. The event is being organise by Colin Mercer and is described as:</p>

<p>We are being encouraged to "live blog" the event.</p>
<blockquote><p>Please come armed with all of your thoughts, opinions and questions for the Bing team. This meet-up is about everyone getting the chance to have their say. We’ll make sure you’re able to live blog during the event</p></blockquote>
<p>So, I'll be armed with my laptop (for tweeting) and HTC Touch Pro (for video, if appropriate) and will try and ask as many questions as possible and get as much information out to the <em>real-time web</em> as I can. My personal angle will be one of technology. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Bing are pushing use of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd251056.aspx">Bing API</a> and <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/">Bing developer centre</a>.</li>
<li>What are they doing to ensure information is available to the <em>real-time web</em> as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions that you'd like asked and I'll do my best to ask them. You can do this in a number of ways. During the event the hashtag in use will be <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23meetbing">#meetbing</a></strong>. Prior to the event I'd suggest people maybe use <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23askbing">#askbing</a></strong>. Failing that you can contact me directly or leave a comment on this blog post.</p>
