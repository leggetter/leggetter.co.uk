<p>I'm looking for a contractor for a provisional 3 month contract with the following skills, experience and interests:</p>
<p><strong>Essential</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>TDD/BDD</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>ADO.NET Entity Framework or other ORM</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Great to have</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Passionate about the real-time web and real-time data (essential for the longer term)</li>
<li>Knowledge of building scalable systems on Amazon Infrastructure</li>
<li>Experience of integrating with 3rd party payment systems and building basic ecommerce functionality</li>
<li>Experience of building a SaaS or IaaS offering</li>
<li>Interest/experience in API and Web Service development</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>The role will be primarily home-based but at times we may need to meet around 2 to 3 times a week at a location that we agree on anywhere between or around Dundee and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Moving forward I'm hopeful that this could develop into a fulltime role so it would be ideal if we could get somebody who was interested in this also.</p>
