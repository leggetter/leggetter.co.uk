<p>
	First, it's worth having a listen to the <a href="http://www.socialmediawhitenoise.com/2010/09/13/46-the-scrambled-egg-show/">Social Media White Noise Podcast episode</a>.
<p />

Part of that is based on an annoyance at so many companies claiming to be SEO companies and "experts". The annoyance is based on knowing that some companies do very little for their money e.g. just update a report template document with the new client details and do a couple of hours research and then charge hundreds of pounds for that document. They have managed to market themselves so well as SEO experts by simply jumping on the bandwagon first and by doing this have managed to make money purely on the basis that companies are blind to what SEO is and that they must have their website SEO'd. Big corporations are terrible in this regard. The same SEO companies are now offering social media services simply because companies now feel they must have a social media presence - another bandwagon opportunity. They charge for setting up Facebook pages, Twitter accounts and blogs but do little else for the client when what they should do is teach clients how to use social media or offer a full managed service which will ultimately transition to an in-house service. The long term full managed services will never deliver any quality as the turn over of staff at big SEO, Digital Marketing or Social Media companies is too large so the service will never be any better than manufactured blog posts from paid bloggers and streams of nonsense from managing twitter accounts. Sorry, rant over.</p></blockquote>

No matter how much fake SEO is applied I hope that Google can see through this and will ultimately (it may take time) work out what the most relevant, and truly natural, results are for your search.</p></blockquote>

However, eventually the Google Algorithm will update, the search results orders will change, the SEO companies will need to do more research and training (maybe at Google), the clients will need to pay more money to have more SEO applied and the search results ordering will update again. And so on.</p></blockquote>

I believe this is largely thanks to the natural weighting applied to social media.</p></blockquote></div></p>
