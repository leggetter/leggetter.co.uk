<p>I've accepted a job down in London so will be selling my lovely flat in Edinburgh. It's a loft apartment really near to all the bars, resteraunts and cafes. I love <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=the+shore+leith" title="Images of The Shore in Leith">The Shore</a> so am disappointed to be moving but I'm sure I'll be back on my holidays.</p>
