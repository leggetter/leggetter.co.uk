<p>Google have released a <a href="http://www.google.com/realtime?esrch=RealtimeLaunch::Experiment">real-time search site</a> aimed at showing search results as it happens. The disappointing thing is that although I&#39;m sure that the results are instantly updated on the server they are not instantly updated in the web browser - they are still polling for new results. This means that the instant you get your search results back that the information is out of date. If a new result comes in between the poll requests then you won&#39;t get that update until the next poll.</p>
<p><b>The experience that this delivers isn&#39;t real-time!</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67P4L320100826">news of the real-time search site was published on Reuters</a> and I was really surprised to see no comment about this at all. They&#39;ve clearly just reported the news and not commented on it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to keep on posting about these annoying stories, products and services until people start treating real-time as real-time. Polling is <b>not</b> real-time. Push <b>is</b> real-time!</p>
