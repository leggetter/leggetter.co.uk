<p><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>I'm doing a real-time web workshop on May 16 for the SPA 2010 Conference and I'd like to do a trial run with a group of around eight people to get feedback and refine it some more. Details about the workshop can be found here:<br />
<a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2010/sessions/session303.html"> http://www.spaconference.org/spa2010/sessions/session303.html</a></p>
<p>In the workshop we'll discuss the real-time web and the enabling technologies, highlight the comet/server push technologies that are presently available, and use the <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika service</a> to show how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add real-time data to any web page</li>
<li>Create a <em>better</em> real-time search results page</li>
<li>Add real-time publishing from a web page</li>
<li>Create a real-time collaboration and communication example</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is sufficient interest I'll try and sort out a venue next week. The workshop will probably take around 3.5 hours so I'll need to sort out times once I get an idea of interest. I'll try to keep the presentation side of things to a minimum and concerntrate on discussion and development exercises. For this we'll need internet access and a computer for development. It may also be a good idea to pair during the exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Where?</strong></p>
<p>Edinburgh or Dundee during the week beginning Monday 10 May 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, please give me a shout if you are interested. Or if you would be interested but don't have that much time to spare maybe we can do a shortened version.</strong></p>
