<p>On Monday we published our <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org/2013/09/16/introducing-bladerunnerjs/">first BladeRunnerJS (BRJS) blog post</a>. It provides an overview of what BRJS is, why it was created and why it's being open sourced. We saw a nice spike in traffic and I was thinking about ways I could try to sustain that. I decided not to take any action (e.g. submit for consideration in JavaScript Weekly) for two reasons; we'd publish plenty more posts over the coming weeks and we don't have any source in <a href="https://github.com/bladerunnerjs/brjs">github</a> right now. It would therefore be much better to focus on getting traffic when there's actually a solution that people can download and try out.</p>

<p><strong>Then, on Friday, <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/archive/148.html">JavaScript Weekly issue 148</a> came out</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Stats</h3>
<p>Some stats for 20th - 21st September, covering around a 24 hours period after JavaScript Weekly came out are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1248 Unique visits</li>
<li>29 mailing list registrations</li>
<li>Around +6 github repo watchers</li>
<li>Around +10 github repo stargazers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, <strong>I'm not saying these are absolutely amazing stats</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brjs-google-analytics-1024x675.png" alt="BRJS Google Analytics" width="1024" height="675" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23958" /></p>
<p>But, a <strong>2% converstion of site hits to mailing list registrations</strong> for a project with only a single blog post, an empty github repo and a <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">landing page</a> available, is actually pretty good. <em>Hopefully it also means the post was quite interesting too!</em></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brjs-mailchimp-emails-1024x538.png" alt="BRJS signup notifications" width="1024" height="538" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23959" /></p>
<p>Beyond that, the other 964 <span style="text-decoration: line-through">visitors</span> <em>developers</em> who have an interest in JavaScript toolkits and frameworks will have at least heard of <strong>BladeRunnerJS</strong> now.</p>
<p>We now need to build on that by - primarily - open-sourcing a quality solution, and then demonstrating its value by continuing to publish interesting content (tutorials, updates and through provoking JavaScript software engineering practices) on our blog.</p>
<h3>The JavaScript Weekly Readership</h3>
<p>I've had a few links published in JavaScript Weekly and I've always seen a tremendous amount of traffic and signups/conversions from the newsletter. I believe that's because it has a readership who are used to receiving a highly focused and well-curated service. Kudos to <a href="http://peterc.org/">Peter Cooper</a> and <a href="http://www.2ality.com/">Dr. Axel Rauschmayer</a> for keeping the quality high and for managing to track everything that's going on in the seriously fast moving world of JavaScript.</p>
<p><em>Note: I've just realised I've probably upped the prices we'll have to pay to <a href="https://cooperpress.com/mediakit2013.pdf">advertise in JavaScript Weekly</a> :)</em></p>
