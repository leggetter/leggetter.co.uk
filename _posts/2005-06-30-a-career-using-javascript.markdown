<p>Since most of the hits to my site will probably be following a search for either "Leggetter" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>" I thought that I had best post something about the latter of these topics.</p>
<p>My knowledge of <strong>JavaScript</strong> has been gained by working for companies that have used Web Technologies in their products. My first job was in London back in 2001 and at this time I would guess that <strong>JavaScript</strong> would not have been classed as a mainstream programming language. I guess that many would still not think of it as mainstream but it certainly has become more prominent with the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>. Its common uses back in 2001 would have been to create rollover effects or dynamically write page content on the client-side <strong>using</strong><code>document.write</code>. However, the company that I worked for used it as a main language to develop a product to deliver real-time financial data in a browser to the PC desktop. So, over my two years at this company my knowledge of this language grew considerably.</p>
<p>As well as <strong>using</strong> <strong>JavaScript</strong> to develop my employers products I used it in developing my own small web applications, web sites and small to medium bits of functionality for friends sites or web applications. I also used to contribute to "comp.lang.<strong>javascript</strong>" and a few forums but as the popularity of the language increased as did the number of people who wanted to ask and solve <strong>JavaScript</strong> questions. Also, as the number of <strong>JavaScript</strong> users increased the number of simply solved questions were asked. It became a challange in itself to find that challanging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHTML">DHTML</a>/<strong>JavaScript</strong> question. With the <strong>JavaScript</strong> community getting so crowded I decided to leave the newsgroups and forums to those with a bit more spare time.</p>
<p>Even though I had decided to leave the forums alone it did not mean that I left <strong>JavaScript</strong>alone. Indeed I made a move north to Scotland to work for a small company that used <strong>JavaScript</strong> and DHTML to deliver simulations of a variety of real life applications. These simulation ran purely in a browser and used a very clever combination of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, HTML, DTHML and Java to deliver high quality simulation products to large financial service companies. Whilst at this company my knowledge of cross-browser compatibility issues increased considerably.</p>
<p>Two years on I made the decision to make a move to a company that did not use <strong>JavaScript</strong> as its primary development language. At the very same time as I had made my decision to move on the idea of AJAX came about and <strong>JavaScript</strong> took another leap in popularity. Whether or not its popularity will mean that my current company come up with more ideas on how to use <strong>JavaScript</strong> in the same guise as Google Maps is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>So, what is the point in this post? Well, I suppose it has turned into a mini <strong>career</strong> biography and also has proven that a <strong>career</strong> in Software Engineering can be acheived <strong>using</strong> <strong>JavaScript </strong>as a primary language - although it has to be said that I was quite lucky that my first two companies were so specialised in its use. I guess the point is also to highlight that I'm very experienced in the use of this language so if anybody has any questions about a piece of <strong>JavaScript</strong> code, a "How To" question or a piece of contract work that they need an experienced <strong>JavaScript</strong>/DHTML developer to take on they should get in touch with me.</p>
<p>A final note that I would like to make is that during my <strong>career</strong> I have gained experience in a variety of other languages as well as general software engineering skills. The languages that I now consider myself very capable of <strong>using</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
<li>DHTML</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>VBScript</li>
</ul>
