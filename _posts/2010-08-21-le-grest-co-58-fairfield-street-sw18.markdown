<p>We live in a flat that was previously occupied by Jo's Grandparents. One of the things we do occasionally is sort out a room or cupboard. Today I'm tidying up a room for a friend to move in whilst he's finishing his University course.</p>
<p>I've already tweeted a number of times about a metal bed that I've had to dismantle. This most recent find isn't all that interesting to look at but when you see a label that details where it was manufactured, and then find that place on Google maps to see the place has clearly completely changed, it becomes interesting.</p>

<p>This piece of&nbsp;furniture&nbsp;is just a table on wheels (I'm sure it has a better name) and it was built by Le Grest &amp; Co. at 58 Fairfield Street SW18. The place in in Wandsworth and was most probably a place where a lot of manufacturing companies set up. But as we move to a tertiary economy these places are torn down and replaced with offices, shops and/or flats.</p>

A google for Le Grest &amp; Co. only turns up a few links. It would appear that they are probably <a href="http://www.ukdata.com/company-credit-reports/LE-GREST-_and-CO.LIMITED..html">no longer building furniture or trading</a>, and that Le Grest was most probably a play on "leg rest" <a href="http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/New_Website/361Stools6475Vintage.html">based on one page</a> and a <a href="http://cgi.cafr.ebay.ca/RETRO-1960-1970-COMFY-LEG-REST-FOOTSTOOL-/180539065355?cmd=ViewItem&amp;pt=UK_Antiques_AntiqueFurniture_SM&amp;hash=item2a08f7840b#ht_822wt_1137">listing on on ebay</a>.</p>
