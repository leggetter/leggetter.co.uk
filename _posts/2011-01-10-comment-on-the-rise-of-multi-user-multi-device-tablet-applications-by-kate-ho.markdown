<p>I've just posted <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/01/10/predictions-for-2011-3-the-rise-of-multi-user-multi-device-tablet-applications/#comment-2030">a comment</a> on a really good article by Kate Ho of Startup Cafe about her predictions on <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/01/10/predictions-for-2011-3-the-rise-of-multi-user-multi-device-tablet-applications">the rise of multi-user, multi-device table applications</a>. Obviously my comments are focused really on the technology behind such a rise. Here's my comment in full, slightly edited to be a bit more readable as a blog post.</p>

Kate - another very insightful post. And another set of predictions that I completely agree with you about and really excite me because I'm working on technology that makes this possible and more easily accessible. For multi-user games and collaborative applications the information about a player move, new document update or chat notification generally needs to be instantly sent to all other users. Even where real-time is not absolutely essential to the application a push notification is still more beneficial (UX and resource usage) than notification via polling.</p>
<p>During the last year we started to see, or at least notice, a lot more real-time collaboration applications and games which used the Internet as the network for the messages. In <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/09/14/client-push-services-open-up-real-time-to-everyone/">this post</a> I wrote for Programmable Web on real-time client push services the first screenshot is of a web-based scrabble-like game.</p>
<p>Some other well know examples are Google Docs documents, drawing and <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=44680">spreadsheets real-time collaboration</a>, <a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a>, <a href="http://pbworks.com/real-time-collaboration">PBWorks</a> and real-time chat services such as <a href="http://nurph.com">Nurph</a> (although they currently use polling). I also think that services such as <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, a UI mocking app, plan to introduce real-time collaboration functionality.</p>
<p>The user experience side of things is also very interesting. When real-time data delivery becomes a possibility the application developer really needs to consider how this impacts the UX. Just because you can stream 1000's of tweets a minute into an application it doesn't mean you should. search.twitter.com is a good example of this; they've chose to just show a notification that new tweets are available rather than actually push them into view. These two examples also show notifications being pushed into view:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.twitterfall.com/">Twitter Fall</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/javascript-examples/simple-twitter-subscriber/">Simple real-time streaming of Tweets demo on Kwwika (click on NOWPLAYING)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love to know what people think about this and hear any idea about how we can solve this real-time notification UX problem.</p>
<p>During 2011 I absolutely believe that we will start to see a lot more real-time and cross platform collaborative applications and games where one user may be on a smartphone, another on a PC running in a web browser and another on a native iPad app. These applications will be powered by real-time technologies either hosted by the game or application developers or using one of the real-time push notification and messaging services that started up last year.</p>
<p>My hope is that people will choose to use a service for that infrastructure and that <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a> is well placed to fill that role by having a foundation of technology developed over 10 years and <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api">APIs</a> for the majority of technologies (JavaScript [Web], Objective-C [iPhone/iPad], C, Java, .NET, Flash, Silverlight).
