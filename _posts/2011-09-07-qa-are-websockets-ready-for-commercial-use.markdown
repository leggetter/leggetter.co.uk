<p>I'm not answering this question directly in the post. I'd like people to ask questions and raise concerns in the comments and I'll then do my best to answer the questions and alleviate any concerns.</p>
<p>I believe that WebSockets are ready for commercial use and I'll justify this stance in answering any questions.</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing your questions and thoughts.</p>
