<p>In my recent talks I always give realtime collaborative code editing as a great example of collaboration. As far as I know <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9</a> are the first to add this features to an online IDE (I've heard such a feature has been available in desktop IDEs for a while).</p>

<p>They use <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> for their solution, which isn't a surprise since they're big on node.js.</p>
<p>The recent mail-out must have really driven some traffic they're way as they've reported:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We are experiencing the highest demand in our history. If you are having issues with your workspace, we are fixing issues now. Sit tight!</p>

<p><strong>I wonder how much this increase in traffic was influence by this new awesome realtime functionality?</strong></p>
