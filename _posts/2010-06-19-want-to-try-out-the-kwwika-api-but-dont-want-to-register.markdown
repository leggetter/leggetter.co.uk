<p>We're try to get more and more people using Kwwika and we feel that registering is maybe a barrier to entry. So, we've decided to give everybody access to our service. The only caveat is that we've just enabled access from your local development machine, assuming you can run a local application from <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>.</p>
<p />
So, if you want to try out the Kwwika JavaScript API but don't want to <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">register</a> (yet), then go ahead. There's a topic that you can subscribe and publish to named /KWWIKA/SANDBOX.</p>
<p />
You can even start building a <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition">Kwwika World Cup 2010 Real-Time Push Web App</a> because we've give <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> access to <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition#TOC-What-data-must-be-used-in-the-web-a">the data you need to use to enter the competition</a>:</p>
<p />
<ul>
<li>
/OPTA/WC2010/TEAMLIVE</li>
<li>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/SEARCHES/WC2010/*</li>
</ul>
<p />
If you need help getting started you can of course <a href="http://kwwika.com/Contact">get in touch</a> or start by going through our <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/the-real-time-web-workshop">Real-Time Web Workshop</a>. This workshop contains a presentation, a set of exercises and all the files (<a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/the-real-time-web-workshop">download</a>) that you need to go through the exercises. This even in includes and executable webserver to run on windows, a webserver app to run on Mac and a python webserver to run on Linux (or any other python enabled machine).</p>
<p />
So, why not start developing using Kwwika now. And if you like it, or are just damn good at developing real-time push apps, why not <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">register</a> and <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition">enter our World Cup 2010 competition</a>.</p>
