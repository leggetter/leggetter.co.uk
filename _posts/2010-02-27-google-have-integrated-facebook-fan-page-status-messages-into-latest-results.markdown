<p>According to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_takes_first_shot_at_facebook_search_results.php">this article</a> by Read Write Web, Bing have exclusive access to the data created by Facebook user status updates and Google have access to the data from Facebook fan page updates. It's interesting to see that this data is so highly valued that there is clearly a bidding war over access to certain types of data. <strong>Which is more valuable?</strong></p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_takes_first_shot_at_facebook_search_results.php"><p>As of today, Facebook Fan Page status updates will begin appearing in Google search results, according toÂ <a href="http://twitter.com/google/status/9599921440">a tweet</a> by Google. The announcement means that we will begin seeing results from the nearly 3 million fan pages, but not from the more than 400 million users.</p></blockquote>
