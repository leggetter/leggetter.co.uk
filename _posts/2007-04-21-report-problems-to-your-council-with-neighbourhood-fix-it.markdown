<p>Rob of <a href="http://www.gisconsultancy.com" title="GIS Consultancy">GIS Consultancy</a> fame recently sent me a link to a website dedicated to tracking and fixing of neighbourhood problems. The <a href="http://www.neighbourhoodfixit.com" title="Neighbourhood Fix It website">Neighbourhood Fix It website</a> is a great idea and it actually works. I reported the dumping of a load of newspapers and leaflets outside of our flat that were just waiting to be set on fire. That same day the Edinburgh "Rapid Response Team" had been out and picked up the papers and leaflets.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neighbourhoodfixit.com" title="Neighbourhood Fix It">Neighbourhood Fix It</a> must have a mapping of post codes to councils and automatically inform the council of any reports in their jurisdiction. The site has been developed by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/" title="mySociety">mySociety</a> who aim to "give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives". I think that <a href="http://www.neighbourhoodfixit.com" title="Neighbourhood Fix It">Neighbourhood Fix It</a> is a great piece of work and a great example.</p>
