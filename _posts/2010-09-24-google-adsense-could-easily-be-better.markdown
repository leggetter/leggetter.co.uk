<p>I was just looking at my web stats and was presented with a Chrome advertisement at the top of the page. But I&#39;m already using Chrome so what&#39;s the point in showing me an advert for it. That&#39;s just a wasted advert impression.</p>
<p />
<div><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> uses JavaScript to display each banner and there are a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=javascript+browser+sniffing#hl=en&amp;expIds=17259,17291,24683,25532,25941,26579,26621,26714,26736,26751&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=javascript+browser+detection&amp;cp=20&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;source=hp&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=javascript+browser+d&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=a10a6dd23ac37a99">tonne of ways</a> you can use JavaScript to detect what web browser the page is rendered in. So, why doesn&#39;t Adsense use this information when it displays an advert. An advert for Internet Explorer would have been much more valid - but wouldn&#39;t have made me switch my browser.</div></p>
