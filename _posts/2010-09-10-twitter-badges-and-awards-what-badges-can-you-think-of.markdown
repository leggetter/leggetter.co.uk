<p>One of the reasons FourSquare is popular is because you can get awards or badges for your check-ins. Would it be of interest to anybody if you could get badges for your tweets? Some ideas for badges:
<ul>
<li> The stalker badge - following more than X users</li>
<li>The noise badge - Tweeting more than X times in the past hour</li>
<li>The chatty badge - replying to X users in the past hour</li>
<li>The profanity badge - swearing more than X times in your past X tweets</li>
<li>The Romani badge - tweeting from more than x locations</li>
<li>The greedy guts badge - tweeting more than x times about food</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you think of some other badges? Would Twitter badges and awards interest you? </p>
