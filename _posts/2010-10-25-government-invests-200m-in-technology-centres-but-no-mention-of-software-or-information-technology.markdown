	I just saw a <a href="http://twitter.com/mhawksey/statuses/28697368351">tweet by @mhawksey</a> linking to a government <a href="http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=416174&amp;NewsAreaID=2">announcement</a>:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> More than £200m will be invested by the Government in a network of elite Technology and Innovation Centres to drive growth in the UK’s most high-tech industries, it was announced today.</p></blockquote>
<p />
<div>And what areas will be targeted?</div>
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> Each centre will focus on a specific technology where there is a potentially large global market and a significant UK capability. Areas identified as possibilities by Hermann Hauser included plastic electronics, regenerative medicine and high value manufacturing. </p></blockquote>
<p />
<div>Plastic Electronics! Regenerative Medicine! High Value Manufacturing!</div>
<p />
<div>No mention of software or Information Technology. When I think of high-tech I think software. I don&#39;t think hardware. Maybe that&#39;s just me?</div>
<p />
<div>Ok, there&#39;s hope yet as the areas were only identified as &quot;possibilities&quot;. What about giving some of that money to the highly innovative software services that are being developed through out the UK?</div></p>
