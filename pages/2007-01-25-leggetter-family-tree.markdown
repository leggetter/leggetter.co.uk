<p><strong>Leggetter</strong> is a unique name. There are very few (comparatively) that share the name <strong>Leggetter</strong>. With this uniqueness comes an interest in where the name came from and who else shares it. So, below is a little family tree to help other <strong>Leggetters</strong> quench that curiosity.</p>

<h2>The Leggetter Family Tree</h2>

<p>The <strong>Leggetter</strong> Family Tree is now available as a modern, searchable web page with information on over 200 family members.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <a href="/leggetter-family-tree/view/" style="display: inline-block; padding: 15px 30px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">🌳 View the Interactive Family Tree</a>
</p>

<p>This family tree was taken from another site on the Internet so if anybody has any problems with it being here just <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">e-mail me</a> and I'll take it down. Also, if you are a <strong>Leggetter</strong> and are not happy with this information being freely available just <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>The information here isn't entirely correct nor, I'm guessing, is it completely up to date but it does provide some interesting information.</p>

<p><em>Note: The raw genealogy data is available in the <a href="/leggetter-family-tree/0001tree.gen">Geneo format file</a> (0001tree.gen).</em></p>
