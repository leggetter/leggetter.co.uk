<p>The old blog is still over @ <a href="http://www.phobos7.co.uk" title="The old Phobos7 blog">http://www.phobos7.co.uk</a> but I've decided to start a new one here on my wonderful new domain. I've been after a <strong>Leggetter</strong> domain for ages but <a href="http://www.leggetter.com" title="Andrew Leggetter's website">Andrew</a> managed to snap them all up way before I even thought about registering one.</p>
