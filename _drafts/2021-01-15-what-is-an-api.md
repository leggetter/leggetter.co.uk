title: "What is an API?"
excerpt: This is a post on my take on a fundamental of something I take for granted and work with daily. But it's important to remember that many people - even those working in this space - don't always have a fundamental grasp on everything they work with. So, this is my attempt to make sure I understand a fundamental and share that opinion - and hopefully knowledge - with others. In this post I'll cover "What is an API?".

This is a post on my take on a fundamental of something I take for granted and work with daily. But it's important to remember that many people - even those working in this space - don't always have a fundamental grasp on everything they work with. So, this is my attempt to make sure I understand a fundamental and share that opinion - and hopefully knowledge - with others. In this post I'll cover "What is an API?".

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs allow functionality offered by one application to be exposed and consumed by other applications through a defined interface. These interfaces are interacted with programmatically, from executing code within an application.

Applications can expose more than one API and information can be passed to APIs when interacted (inputs) with and information returned (outputs).

Microsoft Windows operating system or Apple Macintosh Operating System (MacOS) are applications that expose functionality through APIs that enable other applications to run. For example, they enable applications to create visual representations on the screen and to receive information from keyboard presses and mouse/touchbar movements.

A web browser is an application that runs using APIs exposed by the operating system. As well as utlising display, mouse/touchpad and keyboard APIs it makes use of operating system APIs that expose networking functionality. This enabled the web browser to request and load web pages from other computers running web server applications, over the Internet.
