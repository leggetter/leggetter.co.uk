<p>I came a across a fun little tool that <a href="http://www.leapfish.com/domain_name_appraisal.php" title="Domain name esitmation tool">estimates what your domain is worth</a>. <a href="http://www.leapfish.com/domain_name_appraisal.php?url=microsoft.com" title="Microsoft.com domain estimate">Microsoft.com</a> was worth over $24,000,000 but <a href="http://www.leapfish.com/domain_name_appraisal.php?url=leggetter.co.uk" title="Leggetter.co.uk domain estimate">Leggetter.co.uk</a> was only worth only $36!</p>
<p>Give it a go and see how much your domain comes in at.</p>
<form action="http://www.leapfish.com/domain_name_appraisal.php" method="get">Enter Domain Name: <input name="url" type="text" /> <input value="Get Estimate" type="submit" /> </form>
