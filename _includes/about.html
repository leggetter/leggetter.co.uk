  <p>My name is <strong>Phil Leggetter</strong>. I'm presently focusing on Developer Experience and Developer Relations for a company in stealth mode.</p>
  <p>From 2016 to 2020 I had the pleasure of supporting, enabling and growing a Developer Relations and Platform Experience team at <a href="https://developer.nexmo.com">Nexmo</a> (acquired by Vonage). We grew a team from 3 people to 42 and the team continues to move from strength to strength following my departure. We built a diverse, collaborative, multi-functional, remote-first team spread from San Francisco to Singapore. A team that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Won the very first "Best Overall Developer Relations Programme Award" in 2018</li>
    <li>Won 5 awards for documentation across 2018 and 2019</li>
    <li>Raised awareness in targeted developer communities from 0% to 30%</li>
    <li>Increased monthly developer blog post traffic by over 200% and climbing</li>
    <li>Championed and executed on a new self-serve developer onboarding flow that saw the number of developers that experience our APIs increase by 200%</li>
    <li>â€¦and so much more</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Prior to joining Nexmo I was Head of Developer Relations at <a href="https://pusher.com">Pusher</a> where I wrote documentation, built SDKs, handled support, met customers, frequently wrote articles and gave talks on <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide">Realtime Web Technologies</a> and general Web technology.</p>

  <p>I'm also the co-author of the APress for-beginners title "<a href="http://realtimewebapps.com">Realtime Web Apps</a>".</p>
