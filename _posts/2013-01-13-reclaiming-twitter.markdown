excerpt: "For a long while now I've not been getting as much out of Twitter as I used to. There's too much information to take in. I've long said that Twitter is throw-away. If you miss something then it doesn't matter. If it's important then I'll see a retweet or pick up the information from somewhere else. <strong>This is wrong</strong>. Just because it's not being retweeted by everybody it doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile update. Just because it doesn't get upvoted on Hacker News it doesn't mean that it's not relevant to me."

<p>For a long while now I've not been getting as much out of Twitter as I used to. There's too much information to take in.</p>
<p>I've long said that Twitter is throw-away. If you miss something then it doesn't matter. If it's important then I'll see a retweet or pick up the information from somewhere else. <strong>This is wrong</strong>. Just because it's not being retweeted by everybody it doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile update. Just because it doesn't get upvoted on Hacker News it doesn't mean that it's not relevant to me.</p>
<p>Somethings is wrong with how I use Twitter. I know I'm not getting as much value from it as I should. It's still a great source of information when asking questions. But I want to be able to listen, reply and having better conversations.</p>
<p>I follow(ed) 940 Twitter users. That's too many. <strong>So, I've unfollowed everyone!</strong></p>

<h3>Now to reclaim Twitter</h3>
<p>I'm going to start from scratch. I'm going to follow those that I've had conversations with recently. I'm going to re-follow those that I know I've read tweets from recently and gained value from. I'm going to start following others who I have conversations with or discover again.</p>
<h3>Reclaimed with a hack</h3>
<p>I obviously didn't want to have to do this manually. That would probably have taken a while. I had a quick search for apps to let me unfollow everybody but most apps appear to offer a limited number of unfollows and then require some sort of upgrade. So, I've hacked something together that I can use in future and may be useful to others. It's now in a <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/reclaim-social">Reclaim Social github repo</a>.</p>
