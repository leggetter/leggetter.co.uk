<p>I've just finished giving my presentation on HTML Web Apps in the wild at <a href="http://html5devconf.com">HTML5DevConf</a>. The Wifi stood up so hopefully the second screen experience really helped to demonstrate how realtime web technologies, and of course <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> can be used to enhanced interaction and engagement within applications.</p>
<p>You can find the slides, 2nd screen app and the slides in "controller mode" via:<br />
