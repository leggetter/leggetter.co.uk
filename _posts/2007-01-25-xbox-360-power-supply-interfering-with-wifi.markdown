<p><strong>Update: My post on the XBox360 forum was removed - looks like they are trying to hide the fact that it really is a problem</strong></p>
<p>My fantastic girlfriend bought me an <a title="XBox 360 over on http://www.xbox.com" href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/hardware/xbox360/">XBox 360</a> for Christmas. I got a real bee in my bonet about a 360 ever since I saw the trailers and read the reviews for <a title="Gamespot - Gears of War" href="http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/gearsofwar/index.html">Gears of War</a>. I did consider hanging on for a PS3 but just could stop myself from dropping hints about a 360 for Christmas.</p>
<p>Anyhoooo, I do love my 360 but I've noticed that it badly interferes with my wireless network <em><strong>*</strong></em>. So, I've made a <a title="XBox 360 forum post" href="http://forums.xbox.com/9898711/ShowPost.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">post about the power supply causing wireless interference</span></a> over on the XBox forums to see if anybody else has had a similar problem. I'd really like confirmation that it is the <a title="Link to picture of the XBox 360 power supply" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2005/10/17/is-that-the-xbox-360s-a-c-adapter/">massive power supply</a> that's the issue.</p>
<p>Oh, and I've also already had to have the hard disk replaced because it was corrupt. I just ain't the luckiest!</p>
<p><em><strong>*</strong></em> Setting up the network in the first place certainly wasn't a piece of cake. I'm not using the MIMO technology that I actually bought all the Netgear products for because with the <strong>Auto 108 </strong>option set in the router config the CPUs on both my desktop and laptop go crazy. This is obvoiusly something to do with the netgear drivers but after hours of messing I finally had to set the router to Channel 7 and G-only to get a steady connection that didn't fry the CPUs of my machines.</p>
