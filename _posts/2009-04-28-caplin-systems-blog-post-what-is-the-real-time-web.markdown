<p>About a week ago I wrote a blog article at work entitled "<a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">What is the real-time web?</a>". I'm seeing even more <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&quot;real-time+web&quot;">tweets</a> and <a href="http://blogsearch.google.co.uk/blogsearch?q=real-time%20web">posts</a> about the real-time web and I'd love to hear if other people agree with my opinion on what the real-time web is.</p>
<p>View the <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">What is the real-time web?</a> article <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">here</a>.</p>
