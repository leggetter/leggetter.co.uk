<p>With the reasonable success of <a href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com" title="Recall David Beckham to the England Squad">Bring Back Beckham!</a> I decided to push forward with my next project. The idea behind <a href="http://www.englandgoals.com" title="England Goals">England Goals</a> was to create a site that lists all the goals scored by the England football team and use the increase in the number of goals that can be found on external video sites to my advantage by embedding these user uploaded videos as content.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-18"></a></p>
<p>I've owned the <a href="#" style="text-decoration: line-through;">EnglandGoals.co.uk</a> and <a href="#" style="text-decoration: line-through;">EnglandGoals.com</a> domains for quite a while now and without having any real content on them the EnglandGoals.com site ranks towards the top of the most search engines for the term "england goals" [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=england+goals" title="Google search for England Goals">Google england goals</a> | <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=england+goals" title="Yahoo! search england goals">Yahoo! england goals</a> | <a href="http://search.msn.co.uk/results.aspx?q=england+goals" title="MSN search england goals">MSN england goals</a>].</p>
<p>The main problem now is getting content in the site so I need to try to encourage visitors to submit their favourite goals to the site rather than having to trawl <a href="http://www.youtube.com">You Tube</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</a> for the goals myself. I may need to incentivise this in some way. Maybe allowing the user who submits the goals to have a link to their own site next to their video submission. This way they will have the chance of users being driven to their site.</p>
<p>Why not visit <a href="#" style="text-decoration: line-through;" title="England Goals">England Goals</a> and let me know what you think?</p>
