<p> <strong>Leggetter</strong> is a unique name. There are very few (comparatively) that share the name <strong>Leggetter</strong>. With this uniqueness comes an interest in where the name came from and who else shares it. So, below is a little family tree to help other <strong>Leggetters</strong> quench that curiosity.</p>
<h2>The Leggetter Family Tree</h2>
<p>The <strong>Leggetter</strong> Family Tree that used to be on this page required Java. Since browsers no longer support Java requires Java. It may take a while to load so please be patient. If you cannot see anything below after a while or you know that you do not have java installed then please visit <a href="http://www.java.com">http://www.java.com</a> and install the latest Java Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>This family tree was taken from another site on the Internet so if anybody has any problems with it being here just <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">e-mail me</a> and I'll take it down. Also, if you are a <strong>Leggetter</strong> and are not happy with this information being freely available just <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>The information here isn't entirely correct nor, I'm guessing, is it completely up to date but it does provide some interesting information.</p>

<p>To find somebody in the tree simply right-click and select "Find" from the menu that appears.</p>
