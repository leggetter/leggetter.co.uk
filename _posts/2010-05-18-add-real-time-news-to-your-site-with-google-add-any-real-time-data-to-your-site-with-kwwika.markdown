<p>It's been <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_will_push_real-time_feeds_to_browser.php">revealed</a> that Google are going to release a version of their API that supports Real-Time news push. Real-time push technology has been around for ages and there are a <a href="http://cometdaily.com/maturity.html">number of technologies</a> that allow you to host your own real-time push server. However, more recently hosted solutions have come about. Kwwika is one of these solutions.</p>
<p />

If you want to<strong> add real-time data to your website</strong> then you can easily subscribe to data and have it update instantly in your website.</p>
