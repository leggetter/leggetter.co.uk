      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the next few weeks or months, as I search for my next role, I’m hoping that I’m going to have a few conversations. The purpose of this post is to clarify what I can bring to any company that is considering employing me and what I’m looking for in my next role.</p>

<h2 id="what-ill-bring">What I’ll Bring</h2>

<p>I hope that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leggetter/">my experience</a>, which includes over 20 years of building developer-focused products and engaging with developer communities, speaks for itself. But, here are some highlights that I feel are most relevant to my search for a new role right now.</p>

<h3 id="servant-leadership--team-building">Servant Leadership &amp; Team-Building</h3>

<p>I enjoy helping others succeed, and I have a proven record of seeding, growing, and scaling multi-functional and globally distributed teams.</p>

<p>My biggest challenge and learning experience was growing a DevRel team of three people to become a Platform &amp; Developer Experience team of forty-two people. The team was diverse, collaborative, multi-functional, remote-first and distributed from San Francisco to Singapore, with a multi-million dollar budget and revenue goal.</p>

<p>The teams were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer Experience</strong>: API standards, documentation, dashboards (inc. signup flow), SDKs and sample code. See the <a href="https://developer.nexmo.com">developer.vonage.com</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Education</strong>: Blog posts, streaming, and video content. See <a href="https://learn.vonage.com">learn.vonage.com</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>: Internal and external developer community engagement. See <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/legacy-blog/2018/12/14/onehack-devrel-internal-hackathon-dr">Vonage OneHack</a> and <a href="https://developer.vonage.com/voyagers">Vonage Voyagers</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>End-to-End Experience</strong>: defining, managing, and coordinating the Nexmo and Tokbox to Vonage rebrand and the experience crossing multiple digital assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>These teams delivered business value and <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/legacy-blog/2018/11/28/all-your-devrel-award-belong-to-us-dr">won multiple awards</a> year-on-year.</p>

<h3 id="a-product-first-approach">A Product-First Approach</h3>

<p>I have a background in software engineering, so I am a developer and understand what developers need and care about. You have to start with a product that solves a real problem and provides a really good developer experience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no point in driving developer awareness of a product that provides a poor developer experience.</p>

  <p>– Phil Leggetter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stand by this. And, in some cases, the experience of the Product itself is a fundamental way of raising developer awareness. Stripe is an excellent example of this. But, of course, you also need to raise awareness directly in most cases, but the developer experience has an amplifying effect that must be prioritised.</p>

<p>Inherent in this is that I’m product-minded. I feel I can bring value by either being accountable for key product assets (API standards/design, documentation, other educational assets, sample code, SDKs, and developer consoles or dashboards) or, at a minimum, be a stakeholder. Therefore, I don’t want a role purely focused on marketing activities, as some DevRel roles are. This doesn’t mean I’m against a role within Marketing, but Marketing must be strongly aligned with Product.</p>

<h3 id="business-understanding--strategic-alignment">Business Understanding &amp; Strategic Alignment</h3>

<p>I’ve worked with C-level executives for many years. At Vonage, a public company, I reported directly to the CPO following acquisition and contributed to slide decks for the board and market analysts. As a result, I understand that sometimes competing forces are at play and know when to find alternative solutions, compromise, or pick a battle.</p>

<p>I understand the difference between strategy and tactics (and I’ve got a certificate to prove it). So I can take high-level business objectives and create a strategy to help the business meet those objectives through developer-focused initiatives.</p>

<h2 id="how-ill-assess-the-company">How I’ll Assess the Company</h2>

<p>The main assessment criteria I have (and I have a spreadsheet) are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="be-inclusive--diverse">Be Inclusive &amp; Diverse</h3>

<p>I want to work for a company that understands, accepts, and values the differences between people, including those:</p>

<p>• Of different races, ethnicities, genders, ages, religions, disabilities, and sexual orientations
• With differences in education, personalities, skill sets, experiences, and knowledge bases</p>

<p>The workforce must either already be diverse or a <strong>very</strong> clear programme is in place to increase diversity.</p>

<h3 id="be-developer-focused">Be Developer-Focused</h3>

<p>I’m a developer at heart, and I love to enable other developers. So I want to join a developer-focused company. I’ve previously worked for companies that build products for developers where many employees, including execs, need to be convinced time and time again about the value of developers. Unfortunately, this can also lead to all sorts of decisions being made without consideration for software developers, even those who work there.</p>

<p><em>Note: If you don’t understand the value of developers <a href="https://amzn.to/3nFuVDP">buy “Ask Your Developer” by Jeff Lawson</a> now!</em></p>

<p>So, if the company doesn’t fundamentally understand developers, I’ll need a C-level role to be the “voice of the developer” as a peer to the execs, so I don’t have to spend as much time “managing up”.</p>

<p>No matter the type of company, I want my focus to be enabling a team to serve developers instead of “managing up”.</p>

<h3 id="have-an-exciting-product">Have an Exciting Product</h3>

<p>I’ve learned that it’s important to be excited about the products that the company I work for is building. In the past, the products for companies I’ve most enjoyed working with are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Real-time web technologies: Caplin Systems and Pusher</li>
  <li>An open-source toolkit for building complex JavaScript apps: BladeRunnerJS by Caplin Systems</li>
  <li>APIs for communications such as messaging, voice, and video: Nexmo/Vonage</li>
  <li>Open-source product analytics, including funnels and feature flags: PostHog</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not as interested in roles focused on developer deployment infrastructure/DevOps such as k8s or source control. These are powerful and important products but not something that excites me as much as those listed above.</p>

<h3 id="be-transparent">Be Transparent</h3>

<p>The most transparent company I’ve ever worked for is PostHog, and it’s a big reason I’m disappointed it didn’t work out there. So, I’d like to find a company with a similar level of transparency. An example of this is the <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook">PostHog company handbook</a> was public and open-source, and the executive team minutes and board decks were shared with all employees.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-from-a-role">What I Want from a Role</h2>

<p>My current priorities for my next role are:</p>

<h3 id="developer-experience--relations">Developer Experience &amp; Relations</h3>

<p>I’ve already stated that I’m product-minded, why I feel that benefits a business and that I don’t want to purely focus on marketing to developers. Of course, this will rule me out of some roles, and that’s okay.</p>

<p>I believe a company will get more out of me if I’m responsible for key assets of a developer’s experience with a company’s brand and Product. For example, at Vonage, I was ultimately accountable for all developer touchpoints of the Vonage API platform (Nexmo and Tokbox) except for paid advertising. This enabled the team to think holistically about the experience we were providing to developers and build a more cohesive experience.</p>

<p>I’m looking for a similar opportunity where I am accountable for many developer touchpoints across Product and Marketing. Where I’m not accountable, I’d want to at least be consulted.</p>

<h3 id="an-opportunity-to-learn--grow">An Opportunity to Learn &amp; Grow</h3>

<p>I was on the Nexmo SLT (Senior Leadership Team) and then the Vonage API Core Council (an exec team representing the API group within Vonage). In these groups, I acted as the “voice of the developer” across Vonage and gained a lot of insight into how businesses operate.</p>

<p>I want to build upon these experiences, which means a role such as Chief Developer Relations/Developer Experience Officer would be perfect. However, these roles are few and far between, so a VP-level role that reports directly to a C-level executive would also give me the access I feel I need to learn, grow, and help a team and business be successful.</p>

<h3 id="servant-leadership--team-building-1">Servant Leadership &amp; Team Building</h3>

<p>I work this way, and I want to work with others who do too.</p>

<p>I believe the traditional company org chart should be inverted where the CEO’s role is to support and enable everyone above them. Therefore, my role as a leader within an organisation will be to grow, support and enable a department or team.</p>

<p>I want to work as part of a dedicated team or function. I’m not a standalone individual contributor (IC) though I can be an IC on a team and lead it.</p>

<p>I don’t want to work at a company where leadership means telling a team what to do. And I don’t want my manager to tell me what to do. Instead, I want to be challenged with problems to solve and be enabled and trusted to execute.</p>

<h3 id="to-directly-help-the-business-succeed">To Directly Help the Business Succeed</h3>

<p>I’m a servant leader because I inherently enjoy helping others succeed. This doesn’t mean only helping those I’m asked to support and enable (manage/lead), but also helping anyone that I report to; I want to help make them and the business successful.</p>

<p>In order to be successful, there must be a clear understanding of how I can bring or enable value.</p>

<h2 id="where-now">Where Now?</h2>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>The first version of this post was published on the <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/seed-grow-scale-devrel">PostHog blog on September 30, 2021</a></em></p>

<p><img src="/images/devrel-posthog-roles.png" alt="PostHog DevRel team" /></p>

<p>Developer Relations exists and is executed in different ways at almost every company. Our <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/developer-relations">Developer Relations journey at PostHog</a> has just begun, and we still don’t know exactly what it will look like in the medium term. But we can still assess what our needs are going to look like and formulate a plan to seed, grow, and scale Developer Relations. This plan, at the very least, provides a level of clarity that enables us to move forward as we iterate, learn, and continuously improve.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share the questions I’ve posed myself about seeding, growing, and scaling Developer Relations. I’ll include my general answers and the specifics about how we’re approaching DevRel at PostHog. In doing so, I hope you will find the sharing of these questions, how we intend to answer them, and the process we’ve gone through valuable when planning the growth of your DevRel team.</p>

<h2 id="does-your-company-need-developer-relations">Does your company need Developer Relations?</h2>

<p>This one is simple. If a company has one or more products that developers use, then the answer is “yes” because Developer Relations exists to serve customers who are developers.</p>

<p>Needing DevRel doesn’t instantly mean you need to hire a team or even have a person in a full-time DevRel role. But it does indicate that you need somebody to wear a DevRel hat from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="at-posthog">At PostHog…</h3>

<p>PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform. We do have end-users of PostHog that aren’t developers. But there are plenty of interactions with PostHog from developers. It is installed, maintained, integrated, and also used by software developers with a product mindset. My current thinking is that a key persona for DevRel at PostHog is someone who would identify themselves as a “Product Engineer” or a product-minded software developer.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-developer-relations-do">What will Developer Relations do?</h2>

<p>Responsibilities that could fall to dedicated Developer Relations roles will likely fall to other team members at early stage developer-focused startups. But, as a company grows, there will be a need to have people taking on DevRel in a full-time capacity.</p>

<p>DevRel is a multi-functional profession:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product vision and definition</strong>: Some Developer Relations teams wholly own parts of the product, but this will almost always come hand-in-hand with being responsible for engineering execution, too (see next bullet point). This will include market research, vision setting, and customer interviews to validate ideas or get product feedback. For example, at Nexmo/Vonage where I previously helped grow DevRel, the team was responsible for the API standards and the entire life-cycle of the documentation and server SDKs.</li>
  <li><strong>Engineering execution</strong>: Within DevRel, this is often referred to as “Developer Experience”, “DevX”  or “DX”. It’s unlikely to include responsibility for anything within a core platform but often encompasses ownership of more peripheral product assets such as documentation, SDKs, sample code, plugins, and integrations. The ownership of a documentation platform and docs creation can also fit either here or within Product.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer success</strong>: You sometimes see partner developer advocates or partner engineers within Developer Relations who work directly with customers to help them deploy, integrate, and customize a product. This is most often the case at developer-centric companies with a partner ecosystem of plugins or addons but can sometimes be the case at pure API companies. These roles more traditionally sit within Sales as Sales Engineers or Solutions Engineers.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer-focused marketing</strong>: Ranging from customer enablement through tutorials, screencasts, and onboarding emails, to acquisitional or brand awareness marketing. Yes, DevRel does indeed do marketing; occasionally, very traditional marketing such as sponsorship and paid advertisement for brand awareness and acquisition, but should spend the majority of time on education. The line can get a little blurred here with developer experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>What activities you’ll need your DevRel roles to undertake from the above will depend on the company goals and on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gaps identified in what your existing teams are doing but aren’t going to take on.</li>
  <li>What activities should be handed off from other team functions to allow them to focus elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Company stage of growth or strategic shift that introduces the need, increases the need or identifies an opportunity for DevRel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone who knows me and is reading this may be surprised I’ve not mentioned <a href="http://www.leggetter.co.uk/aaarrrp">AAARRRP, the DevRel strategy framework</a> yet. Well, there you go. The point of AAARRRP is to help you <strong>map your company’s goals to DevRel activities that can help you achieve those goals</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="at-posthog-1">At PostHog…</h3>

<p>PostHog has seen significant growth over the past year resulting in a <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/15-million-series-b">Series B raise</a>. Following this, James and Tim, our co-founders, decided it was the right time to introduce dedicated DevRel roles (I’m particularly pleased about this because it means I now get to work here!). Before this, all potential DevRel activities were spread across other team members. But, because PostHog is a developer-centric company, operates with <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/why-small-teams">small teams</a>, and embraces <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#step-on-toes">stepping on toes</a>, people need to continue to do what’s required to ship. There are, however, some gaps and opportunities where DevRel can make improvements or begin new activities.</p>

<p>In the near term, our AAARRRP goals are Activation, Retention, Referral, and Product. Instead of narrowing in on specific activities, we’ve broadly mapped the priorities as:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Oversee documentation</strong>: This isn’t about dictating how documentation is written or being a gatekeeper. It’s about encouraging and enabling consistency, having the time to iterate on content that could otherwise become stale, and identifying gaps based on analysis, feedback, or utilizing team experience. DevRel, much like our <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/design">amazing design team</a>, can function as a service team with people deployed to the small team that most requires them at that time.</li>
  <li><strong>Catalyze our community</strong>: We have a thriving community across <a href="https://github.com/posthog">our GitHub repos</a> and the PostHog community Slack. On GitHub, we reward contributions with thanks on our READMEs, a listing on the <a href="https://posthog.com/contributors">Contributors page</a> of our website, and credit for our <a href="https://merch.posthog.com">merch store</a>. But we want to do more to build upon this fantastic foundation because <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/business-model#why-would-you-work-on-the-community-edition">community is core to our business</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Engage with broader developer communities</strong>: Right now, the only community we actively engage with is the one we’ve built. We need to expand our reach and build relationships within communities that will benefit from the PostHog platform.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-developer-relations-roles-do-you-need">What Developer Relations roles do you need?</h2>

<p>The roles your company needs depend on the focus and activities undertaken by people within DevRel roles.</p>

<p>The most frequently found roles within Developer Relations and the activities they undertake are<sup>†</sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer Advocate</strong>: A generalist role who takes on numerous DevRel activities. This role is also the role you’d expect to see out representing your brand within external communities.</li>
  <li><strong>[Developer] Community Manager</strong>: Responsibilities will range from defining programs that enable community engagement and growth to event management.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Educator</strong>: A role focused on content and code samples that educate developers - normally expected to focus on written and video content as well as possible courses or self-paced learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Evangelist</strong>: Like the developer advocate, this is a generalist role traditionally associated with marketing-focused activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Relations Engineer</strong>: A newer catch-all job title for a code-focused role within DevRel. The job spec for this role is frequently very similar to that of a Developer Advocate.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Experience Engineer</strong>: Focusing on the experience that developers have when using a product. Covers documentation, API standards and specs, SDKs, code samples, integrations, and other assets directly touched by the developer customer.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><sup>†</sup> <a href="https://noti.st/leggetter/9B23EW/defining-the-roles-within-developer-relations-v0-1-0#s6yhNbi">Source: Most popular roles within Developer Relations</a></em></p>

<h3 id="at-posthog-2">At PostHog…</h3>

<p>We’ll hire based on our activities priority list:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Oversee documentation</strong>: A role we’re actively hiring for is a <a href="https://apply.workable.com/posthog/j/F928106DB5/">Developer Educator</a> who will focus on documentation and enabling our existing customer base, making it easier for Data Engineers to integrate with PostHog. We’ve gone with this role over Technical Writer (omitted from the list above because it’s a very broad job title) because, although the initial focus is docs, we do want this person to engage with the community and create other types of educational content in the future. I would like to hire a Tech Writer in the future to help provide even more structure and standardization to our docs.</li>
  <li><strong>Catalyze our community</strong>: The hire we require for this is a Community Programs Manager to define programs and execute on them.</li>
  <li><strong>Engage with broader developer communities</strong>: Once we’ve identified key external communities, we’ll hire a Developer Advocate with the interests and skills required to authentically engage with those communities.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-do-you-seed-and-grow-developer-relations">How do you seed and grow Developer Relations?</h2>

<p>In early-stage startups that need Developer Relations, the go-to hire is frequently a Developer Advocate because this person will have to do a bit of everything. The company is probably still trying to work out what DevRel will do.</p>

<p>The other roles that are often the first DevRel hires are Technical Writers and Developer Educators because documentation, sample code, and exceptional developer content is fundamental to developer-focused products. A Developer Educator role has more of a focus on community engagement activities such as blog posts and video creation.</p>

<p>As a company grows, there will be more specialization. This isn’t specific to DevRel and is common across many functions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/devrel-seed-grow-grow-more-diagram.png" alt="DevRel: Seed, grow, and, grow more by function" /></p>

<p>You may begin by hiring one or more generalist Developer Advocates who will contribute to docs, update and maintain SDKs, create sample code, and engage with external communities. It’s also likely that you’ll need to bring a Community Manager on board to engage with directly and facilitate broader engagement with communities.</p>

<p>As the company and thus DevRel team grows, you’re going to need specialist roles.</p>

<p>For example, you can create a Developer Experience team of Technical Writers/Developer Educators and Developer Experience Engineers that focus on documentation, SDKs, and sample code. Developer Advocates will then shift focus to more community engagement activities such as workshops, meetups, speaking, and continuously gathering feedback directly from developers or identifying technology trends within communities. In addition, you may create a Developer Education team focused on blog and video content because 2020 has demonstrated the value of companies having such dedicated developer content teams.</p>

<p>As this growth-fueled shift occurs, it’s essential to understand that you’re changing the roles’ definition - or at least the potential breadth. You may lose people who like being a generalist unless you can continue to allow them to contribute outside of their specialization. For example, Developer Advocates are likely hands-on coders, so when shifting, ensure they still have opportunities to contribute to docs, SDKs, and sample code.</p>

<h3 id="at-posthog-3">At PostHog…</h3>

<p>I’ve been hired as the first person in Developer Relations, and I’ve spent some time working on docs, engaging with our community on GitHub and Slack, have organized some newsletter sponsorship, and am taking a look and upgrading our swag/merch. I’m the generalist first hire.</p>

<p>The “What DevRel roles do you need?” section outlines our likely short-term hiring plan of Developer Educator, Community Programmes Manager, a Developer Advocate, and ideally a Technical Writer. Beyond that, I can see a few growth opportunities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>More Developer Educators</strong>: I see the benefit of more Developer Educators joining the team to ensure that we have content that enables developers to deploy, maintain, scale, integrate, and extend (see <a href="https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/plugins">plugins</a>) the PostHog open-source platform. As we grow, I can see people in these roles specializing in either existing customer education (Activation) or using educational content to reach new developers (Acquisition). A rotation schedule<sup>††</sup> could be implemented to ensure opportunities to maintain a broad skillset exist.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Advocates for external communities</strong>: As we identify key external communities, there’s a definite benefit to having developer advocates focused on them. At Nexmo/Vonage, we hired programming language developer advocates (JS, Python, Ruby, PHP, C# .NET, Java etc.) because we believed a communications API platform has potential value to most developers. At PostHog, the advocacy roles are more likely to be focused on:
    <ul>
      <li>General web and app technology trends such as Next.js, Gatsby, Supabase, Sanity.io, Netlify, Vercel etc. used by progressive companies who are building new or actively upgrading products. For this, a Jamstack Advocate may be the correct role.</li>
      <li>Data storage, manipulation, and transformation technologies such as Snowflake, Data Bricks, Google/BigQuery, Microsoft Azure/SQL Data Warehouse, ETL platforms, etc. A Data Cloud Advocate may be the right role to focus on these technologies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create a startup program</strong>: In the same way that every company needs to send email to engage with their customers, every company needs to understand and improve how their customers are using their product. I use this analogy because SendGrid were very successful in their work with startup communities. So, working with startup incubators and accelerators to ensure PostHog is the go-to product analytics platform is a no-brainer to me. Starting with FinTech may be a good approach since it will align with our focus on companies that have a fundamental need for privacy and data control.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><sup>††</sup> I can see value in a rotation schedule being across multiple DevRel roles and also into non-DevRel roles.</em></p>

<h4 id="a-developer-relations-guild">A Developer Relations Guild</h4>

<p>As things stand, I don’t believe we’re going to form a “DevRel team”. Instead, I believe we’ll have a <strong>DevRel Guild</strong> where DevRel roles will reside within “small teams”, providing DevRel skills to those teams as they need them. If we grow as outlined above, I can see teams formed that consist mainly of DevRel roles with a focus on experience, education, and marketing.</p>

<p>How we grow will change with the company needs, but this gives us a few directions we could potentially go in.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-scale-developer-relations">How do you scale Developer Relations?</h2>

<p>I believe there are three key factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A team structure that empowers and provides focus.</li>
  <li>Work with customers, partners, and community.</li>
  <li>A transparent change management process that ensures the team can provide input and feedback.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="an-empowering-team-structure">An empowering team structure</h3>

<p>I’ve already covered that with growth comes specialization. Specialization results in focus, and a team will ultimately be able to deliver more that way; a team asked to focus purely on developer content creation will deliver more than a team asked for write docs, update SDKs, write sample code, write blog posts, manage and present on Twitch streams, and speak at events.</p>

<p>Team structure can be <strong>Functional</strong>, <strong>Multi-Functional</strong>, or <strong>Regional</strong>, but the DevRel roles should be focused.</p>

<p>Examples of <strong>Functional</strong> and focused DevRel teams are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer Experience</strong>: API standards, documentation, code samples, SDKs, libraries, other tooling that enables developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Education</strong>: Developer enabling content covering documentation, blog posts, static video, live video, and other educational materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>: Creating and managing programs for customers, partners, and third-party communities. At some companies, this team can also support and enable community within the company.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrations &amp; Partnerships</strong>: Integrations with third-party technologies used by developers, direct integrations with key customers, or helping build an ecosystem with partners such as those seen with Slack apps, Salesforce apps etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a <strong>Multi-Functional</strong> team set up where a team consists of Product Managers, Engineers, DevRel roles, and Marketing roles, the specialization may change from sprint to sprint as a product moves through the product life-cycle; from inception/proof of concept through to a go-to-market phase. <em>Occasionally</em> changing specialization can be a good setup for a generalist developer advocate, allowing them to apply their broad range of skills but still have time to focus in stages as product development progresses.</p>

<p>For example, the DevRel role’s focus may shift:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proof of Concept</strong>: At this stage, the person in the DevRel role may be “customer zero” (see <a href="https://developerrelations.com/dev-rel/the-developer-advocate-as-customer-zero">the developer advocate as customer zero</a>), providing feedback and acting as a customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Development</strong>: Continuing to act as “customer zero” as well as preparing the assets and structure for the beta (or other early access) program.</li>
  <li><strong>Beta</strong>: Executing on the beta plan, using this stage to raise awareness and excitement with developers, enabling developers with the product, and getting product feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Go-to-market</strong>: Ramping up activities focused on awareness, acquisition, and activation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regional</strong> teams are are often multi-functional but, as you’d expect, focus on a specific geographic location. You’ll most likely see this as the number of DevRel roles at a company gets to a point where it’s possible to justify having North American, EMEA, and APAC regional teams.</p>

<p>It’s always important to be collaborative. But there’s also a lot of value in not having to collaborate on absolutely everything to get something done. Therefore, a team should be <strong>empowered</strong> as much as possible to do everything they need to get stuff done; equipment, software, skills, authority, budget, and more. If you’re leading a DevRel team, this most definitely means support. Your role as a leader of a DevRel team - and any empowered team - is to support and enable them, not tell them what to do.</p>

<h3 id="work-with-customers-partners-and-community">Work with customers, partners, and community</h3>

<p>When scaling, it’s essential to think beyond simply adding headcount. That, in itself, isn’t scaling. You’re only really scaling a team if further investment increases output more than the increase in input. For example, if a Developer Education team of five people produces five pieces of content a week (one piece per person), adding another person should result in the team producing more than one additional piece of content a week. The additional headcount should help the team be more efficient or create new programs that result in exponentially more content (at least more than one piece per week from the previous example).</p>

<p>So, how do you scale DevRel? As discussed, a specialized, focused, and efficient team is a step in the right direction. But, the real opportunity to scale is through collaboration with customers, partners, and your broader community. Let’s use the word “community” to encapsulate customers, partners, and the wider community to simplify things.</p>

<p>Firstly, you should work for and with your community to create a <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html">flywheel effect</a>. You should do this in combination with programs that support and enable collaboration. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open-source</strong>: Open-source as much as you can to enable your community to provide feedback and contribute. At a minimum, this should include your documentation, sample code, SDKs, and API specifications. If possible, open-source your whole platform (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model">open-core</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Value-add “write for us” program</strong>: “Write for us” programs shouldn’t be a cheap way to get content. But, they can be effective if they provide genuine value to the author. Beyond payment or a donation to a charity chosen by the author, this means providing detailed feedback on content to help the author improve as a writer and software developer, attributing the content to the author and promoting it with acknowledgement to help them grow their profile.</li>
  <li><strong>Rewards &amp; heroes program</strong>: Have a clear reward structure for contributions, celebrate your MVPs, and when you feel there’s a large enough community to justify it, create a hero or ambassador program.</li>
  <li><strong>Meetups program</strong>: There are two approaches you can take here:
    <ol>
      <li>If you have a symbiotic alignment with an existing technology trend, it’s worth reaching out to existing meetup organizers and offering sponsorship. You will initially get out what you put in but, over time, this will create the desired flywheel effect.</li>
      <li>If you’re fortunate enough to have a large or highly dedicated community, it’s worth considering creating a mechanism that allows your heroes or ambassadors to organize meetups. Create a meetup organizer package and help your hero set up, run, and support the meetup.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As with many things in DevRel, these are unlikely to be quick wins. But, as the community grows, engages, and contributes, the velocity of the flywheel increases. As this happens, the community is increasingly responsible for the input and output as you work to scale your DevRel program. A word of caution: do not start too many programs in parallel. Instead, identify the one with the highest value and get that right first. Then, move on to the program with the next highest value.</p>

<h3 id="change-management">Change management</h3>

<p>I’ll admit this sounds very <em>enterprisey</em>, but change management isn’t something that should only happen in enterprise organizations. I’ve seen change mismanaged at both startups and enterprises, and because I’ve felt this pain and managed the fallout, I know it’s so important.</p>

<p>The approach <strong>not</strong> to take is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arbitrarily assign a person or team to make a change.</li>
  <li>That team dictates the change with the support of the company executives without asking for any feedback.</li>
</ol>

<p>A simple yet much better approach is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify that a change is required.</li>
  <li>Identify key stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Assign one or more people as responsible for proposing the change. Ideally, include stakeholders within this team.</li>
  <li>Ensure everyone is aware of the change process, share a timeline of events, including when input and feedback is requested, and that the team responsible for the change is responsible for the decision.</li>
  <li>Allow the team to do their work and come up with one or more potential changes.</li>
  <li>Get feedback and iterate. More iterations will mean more time.</li>
  <li>The team should thank everyone for their feedback, share the decision, and explain why they made that decision.</li>
  <li>Everyone gets behind the decision and moves on.</li>
</ol>

<p>This process will take a bit more time. But, because everyone has had an opportunity to contribute, they’re more likely to be bought into the decision. At the very least, they’ll understand why the decision was made. If you don’t involve people impacted by the change, you may have made the decision faster, but you’ll fight inertia and get to the desired destination slower.</p>

<h3 id="at-posthog-4">At PostHog…</h3>

<p>It’s just too early to know if DevRel will need to scale significantly. But I’ll ensure we approach it as outlined in this section.</p>

<h2 id="what-function-should-developer-relations-be-part-of">What function should Developer Relations be part of?</h2>

<p>Developer Relations typically reports into Marketing, Product, or Engineering. However, in smaller companies, DevRel may directly report to a founder.</p>

<p>Two things should determine what function or who DevRel reports to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal alignment</strong>: As you’ve put together the DevRel strategy, you’ve identified what you expect DevRel to help the company achieve. Which other function shares these goals? If your goals are around Awareness and Acquisition, then Marketing may be the right fit. If it’s Activation and Product, then Product or Engineering is likely better aligned.</li>
  <li><strong>Supportive leadership</strong>: The person that a DevRel person or team reports to must be supportive of the idea of Developer Relations. Ideally, they’ve also some experience of either working in DevRel or supporting a team before. If not, you’re in for a rough ride. Would you have a CTO who hasn’t written any code before? Have a watch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUt77eE5QRI">Get executive buy-in… or else by Jessica West</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="at-posthog-5">At PostHog…</h3>

<p>At the time of writing this (September 2021), PostHog is around thirty people, so I report to James, our CEO. Has James worked in DevRel before? No. But he can code, is the co-founder of an engineering-lead company, and believes in the power of the developer.</p>

<p>Will DevRel always report into the CEO? It’s too early to say. As you’ll see above, we’re still iterating, and things will change.</p>

<h2 id="developer-relations-at-your-company-will-change">Developer Relations at your company will change</h2>

<p>DevRel at your company will change, and DevRel at PostHog will change (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn4mdEa8f2Q">DevRel: from startup to enterprise</a>). DevRel isn’t any different to any other role or function in this respect. However, it does feel like there is often some uncertainty about DevRel and that Developer Relations teams have endured more change than traditional functions. I believe this is because “modern Developer Relations” (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFGDzaLiAnM">History of Modern Developer Relations by Brandon West</a>) is still a relatively new profession in comparison to the likes of Engineering or Product.</p>

<p>Developer Relations at some companies, such as Twilio, is seen as a constant. Those who have worked in the industry for a while have seen DevRel teams come and go, which can be unnerving. However, there is no doubt that, when understood, supported, well-executed, and measured correctly, a DevRel team can significantly influence the success of a company and, in some cases, be transformative.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/blog/jobs-grass-isnt-always-greener</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://share.descript.com/view/gVn4KDWrmsE">Listen to the audio version on Descript 🔉</a></p>

<p>It’s been just over eight months since I left Nexmo/Vonage, where I’d been for over four years, and I’ll admit to having spent a few hours reflecting upon my decision to leave. It’s also that time of year when many people seem to get a new job and change companies so now seems like a good time to share some advice and some of my experiences.</p>

<p>When frustrated or tired of a job the most obvious reaction for many is to look for another job at another organisation. Sometimes a change in scenery can be what you need. The grass may be greener on the other side. But, there’s also a chance it won’t be and a move may not always be what you need. So, it’s worth considering alternative options.</p>

<h2 id="take-a-break">Take a Break</h2>

<p>Before you make any hasty decisions take some time off from your current role and try not to think about it. This will give your subconscious a chance to really process things. If you need an extended amount of time and if you’ve been at a company for a long time then a sabbatical may be an option. Failing that, and not everyone will be able to do this, you could consider some unpaid leave.</p>

<p>With your mind hopefully relaxed, and if you still feel like a change is required, it’s time to consider your options.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-reason-for-moving-on-fundamental">Is the Reason for Moving on Fundamental?</h2>

<p>It’s important to ask yourself if you’re moving on for a <strong>fundamental</strong> reason. For example, do you dislike the company values, mission, goals or culture? These things are very difficult to change unless you are part of the company leadership team. Some teams within organisations can have their own culture, values and mission, and generally, be able to function independently. But, for a team to be successful within a business over a long period there has to be a reasonable alignment between a team and a company. So, unless you see positive leadership changes coming this is probably a scenario where the best thing is to move on.</p>

<p>If you’re considering moving on for reasons other than a fundamental problem with the company you work for, there are alternatives. Which of these are available will depend on the company but they are worth exploring.</p>

<h2 id="try-a-different-role">Try a Different Role</h2>

<p>If you have a reasonably broad range of skills, the company you work for requires some of your other skills, and another role available, trying that different role may be an option. Some companies may invest in retraining you so that you can take on that role.</p>

<p>For example, within <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html">Developer Relations</a> it may be possible to move from Developer Advocacy, where there’s a requirement for a broad range of skills, to something more focused like Developer Education.</p>

<h2 id="propose-an-alternative-role">Propose an Alternative Role</h2>

<p>If there are things that you want to do that you’re not presently getting to do why not see if you can create an alignment between the company, team and your goals?</p>

<p>Back in 2010 while working as an engineering team lead at Caplin Systems, I decided I wanted to focus on <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/">real-time web technologies</a>. I liked the people I worked with and the company I worked for was progressive and supportive. So, I spoke to the leadership team about my goals and we came up with the idea of putting our real-time technology in the cloud and making a <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/kwwika">hosted service</a> available to developers. This created a new role for me and began my journey into Developer Relations.</p>

<h2 id="change-teams">Change Teams</h2>

<p>Can you change teams? This is likely only going to be an option at larger organisations where there are multiple teams with the same role. But moving teams, working with new people and taking on new challenges could be the change that you need.</p>

<h2 id="maybe-the-grass-will-be-greener">Maybe the Grass Will be Greener</h2>

<p>Once you’ve considered all the alternatives you may decide it really is time to move on.</p>

<p>When I decided to move on from Nexmo/Vonage I was sure it was the right move but, over the past eight months, I have had the occasional moment where I wondered if I made a mistake. I’m very proud of the Platform &amp; Developer Experience team (including DevRel) we’d built at Nexmo/Vonage and many of the people in the wider organisation were nice.</p>

<p>However, upon reflection, I did make the right decision. For me it was fundamental: I felt that the company was going in the wrong direction from both a cultural and product perspective. I also looked at the VP (in all but title) job that - through the team’s success - I’d ended up in and it was not the sort of role I wanted within Vonage at that time. So I discussed the situation with my colleagues, with leadership, wrote up a job spec for my successor and decided it was time to move on.</p>

<p>So, if you’re reading this because you’ve been wondering if the grass will be greener, please do ensure you’ve considered all your options before making your decision. Whatever you decide, good luck! 🍀</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/25/describe-publish-consume-realtime-data.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the first post in the series we covered <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/08/14/discovering-realtime-data-in-your-apps.html">discovering real-time data</a> within your systems and applications. In part two we went through the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/24/use-cases-for-your-realtime-data.html">use cases for your real-time data</a>. In this final section we’ll cover <strong>the how</strong>: how to describe, publish &amp; consume real-time data from your systems and expose the data so that you can build real-time features.</p>

<p>The main steps we’re going to cover are doing the following with the real-time event data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyse/Process</li>
  <li>Describe</li>
  <li>Publish</li>
  <li>Consume and Use</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysing--processing-real-time-data">Analysing &amp; Processing Real-Time Data</h2>

<p>The amount of analysis and processing of your data that is required really depends on whether the data is already in a form that you can instantly use. If it’s very <strong>simple data</strong> and you have everything you need then you can instantly share it to be used within apps. If it’s <strong>complex data</strong> or requires some additional analysis then you need to do that work before you share it.</p>

<p>Unless there amount of work you’re doing on the data is minimal it’s recommended that you do that work asynchronously. If you got that data from a system interaction, such as a web request, then doing the work there will delay the response to that web request. The same rule applies if you need to put the data into a database in order to perform a query; don’t perform the query within the same context (thread) as the one you received the event and associated data. Instead, do the work in another process.</p>

<p>Here’s one approach to doing this correctly.</p>

<h3 id="example-using-rethinkdb">Example: Using RethinkDB</h3>

<p><a href="http://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> is an open source database built for the real-time web. The reason it’s such a good fit is due to a feature called <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/">changefeeds</a>. In the following example, where <code>r</code> is the RethinkDB reference, we first update the number of <code>points</code> that a player has:</p>

<pre><code>r.table("players")
  .get(playerId)
  .update({points: newPoints})
  .run(conn, callback);

</code></pre>

<p>We have <code>playerId</code> to identify a player to update and we’re updating the <code>points</code> value to be <code>newPoints</code>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in code (another file or even another process entirely) we could have the following:</p>

<pre><code>r.table('players')
  .orderBy(index=r.desc('points'))
  .limit(5)
  .changes().run(conn)
  .then(top5pointsUpdated);

</code></pre>

<p>We’re querying the <code>players</code> table, ordering the result <code>desc</code>ending by points and limiting the number of results by <code>5</code>. There’s nothing particularly different in this approach to any other database (other than maybe the ReQL syntax). The interesting bit is that the <code>top5pointsUpdated</code> function passed to <code>then</code> is called any time that the query result changes. That’s because we’ve identified this query as a changefeed through the use of <code>changes()</code>. So, any time the <code>update</code> code we covered earlier is executed the <code>top5pointsUpdated</code> function will be called.</p>

<p>In a more traditional database these could be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_trigger">triggers</a>. The main things are that it’s <em>evented</em> and that it nicely separates the updating code from the changefeed (trigger) handling code. The asynchronous nature of this code allows it to be executed outside of the incoming event thread/context or in a different process. This is just one example and there may be other solutions allow you to achieve similar functionality.</p>

<h2 id="describing-real-time-data">Describing Real-Time Data</h2>

<p>Systems, applications, and developers building real-time applications and features need a way of registering their interest in data. One of the simplest and most commonly used approaches to this is provide a name or identifier for the data that can be used when registering interest. Publish-Subscribe fits very well here, where data is identified by a <code>channel</code>, <code>topic</code> or <code>subject</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to being able to identify what the data is, it’s very useful – especially within evented systems – to know what is happening to the data. What event has taken place that has resulted in the new or changed data? We call this <strong>Evented Publish-Subscribe</strong>.</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use channels, topics or subjects to identify the data</li>
  <li>Use events to identify what is happening to the data</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve got relatively simple data within your systems then deciding how to identify the data can be easy. There may be a database schema or document that already exists with a name that you can also use as the channel name. Or if you’re using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> solution then the model name may be a good name for the channel. So, for an activity stream where there’s a database table called <code>activities</code> or in an ORM where there’s a model called <code>Activity</code> then <code>activities</code> is a good choice for a channel name.</p>

<p>When it comes to naming events – what has happened to the data – then the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> terminology may be the right solution; <code>created</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>updated</code> and <code>deleted</code>/<code>destroyed</code>. It may be that <code>read</code> is used much less than the other operations, although building features that inform other users that somebody is accessing data can be really useful.</p>

<p>For more complex data it’s probably best to name the channel based on the analysis or query that’s taking place. In the RethinkDB example we covered earlier we were creating a query representing the top 5 players in a game. So, a channel named <code>top-5-players</code> would be a good channel name and <code>updated</code> may be an appropriate event name.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-real-time-data">Publishing Real-Time Data</h2>

<p>Once you’ve described your data you need a mechanism for distributing that data to interested parties (we’ll cover how those parties register their interest in the next section).</p>

<p>In the following example using the <a href="https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2">node-orm2</a> ORM package and the Socket.IO we’ll see how this can be achieved for a simple data change:</p>

<pre><code>Activity.create(
  {text: "Phil is talking"},
  function(err, activity) {
    if(err) throw err;

    io.of('/activities').emit('created', activity);
  });

</code></pre>

<p>In this code a new activity has been created so we’ve triggered an event called <code>created</code> on the <code>activities</code> namespace passing the newly created <code>activity</code> as the event data payload.</p>

<pre><code>Activity.get(activityId, function (err, activity) {
  activity.text = "Phil is still talking";
  activity.save(function (err) {
    io.of('/activities').emit('updated', activity);
  });
});

</code></pre>

<p>The code above shows that updating is simply a matter of changing the event name to <code>updated</code>. You can work out how <code>deleted</code> and any other event could easily be represented in code and communicated.</p>

<p>For the RethinkDB, more complex example we looked at earlier, the code would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>r.table('players')
  .orderBy(index=r.desc('points'))
  .limit(5)
  .changes().run(conn)
  .then(top5pointsUpdated);

function top5pointsUpdated(cursor) {
  var top5 = [];
  cursor.each(function(err, item) {
    top5.push(item);
  });
  io.of('/top-5-players').emit('updated', top5)
});

</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: In the above code we know the function passed to <code>cursor.each</code> called synchronously</em></p>

<p>In the above code we’ve implemented the <code>top5pointsUpdated</code> function. It loops over the updated result, adds those results to an array and triggers and event via Socket.IO. The name of the channel is <code>top-5-players</code>, since that’s the query being made and clearly identifies what the data is. The name of the event is <code>updated</code> since the result value has been updated.</p>

<p>In this example we’re using RethinkDB for the processing and analysis, and Socket.IO for the publishing of the data. Other solutions will offer similar abstractions to help you process and then publish your real-time data.</p>

<p>For completeness, here are some of the examples of publishing data for the other scenarios that were mentioned in the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/08/14/discovering-realtime-data-in-your-apps.html">discovering real-time data</a> blog post.</p>

<h3 id="web-endpoints">Web Endpoints</h3>

<p>In this example using the <a href="https://socket.io">Socket.IO</a> the code triggers an event any time the <code>/interact</code> web endpoint is accessed. It then triggers an event on the <code>endpoints</code> channel with an event name of <code>new_interactions</code>. The event data is the parameters that are used when accessing the endpoint.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">app.post('/interact', function (req, res) {
  io.of('/endpoints',
        'new_interaction',
        {
          endpoint:'interact'
          post_data: params
        });
        
  res.status(200)
})
</code></pre>

<p>You could create some middleware that intercepts web requests and instead share the endpoint that was interacted with along with the HTTP parameters as the event data. Using this you could build a real-time analytics dashboard.</p>

<h3 id="requests--responses">Requests &amp; Responses</h3>

<p>Setting up a request:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">var request = require('request');
var url = 'http://www.google.com';
io.of('web-request').emit('outgoing', {url: url});

</code></pre>

<p>Making the request, handling the response and sharing the data:</p>

<pre><code>request(url, function (error, response, body) {
  if(error) {
    io.of('/web-request').emit('incoming-error', {url: url, error: error});
  } else {
    io.of('/web-request').emit('incoming-success', {url: url, body: body});
  }
});

</code></pre>

<p>This example may be useful for some kind of real-time analytics, but could also be useful if you wanted to make a call to a process to kick-off the request and then let you real-time framework – Socket.IO in this case – inform you when the result is ready (background process completion notifications). In the code above we’ve used the event names, <code>incoming-error</code> or <code>incoming-error</code>, to identify if the request was successful or not. This separation also makes it clear that the event data we get for each will be different.</p>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Logging for custom system analytics:</p>

<pre><code>var winston = require('winston');
function log(level, data) {
  winston.log(level, data);
  io.of('/logging').emit(level, data);
}
log('info', {'some': 'data' });

</code></pre>

<p>This example just uses a <code>log</code> function wrapper to both log using <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">Winston</a> and also emit an event via Socket.IO. In real life you may instead create a <code>realtime-log-listener</code> and configure your logging to use that. In this example the channel is hard-coded to <code>logging</code> and the event name is the log level. But it could be that using the level as the channel name (e.g. <code>logging-{level}</code>) may be a nicer approach to partition the data.</p>

<h2 id="consuming--using-real-time-data">Consuming &amp; Using Real-Time Data</h2>

<p>Now that it’s clear how the data is published, how do you go about consuming that data within an application? Well, we’ve covered how we identify and describe the data earlier so we use that mechanism for consuming the data. Again, we’ll show an Evented Publish-Subscribe example using Socket.IO.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at the code for publishing the data from the server:</p>

<pre><code>var activities = io.of('/activities')
activities.emit('created', activity);
activities.emit('updated', activity);
activities.emit('deleted', activity);

</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding code uses the <a href="https://socket.io">Socket.IO</a> in the client (the consumer) to identify the data (using namespaces) and then register interest in what’s happening to the data (using events):</p>

<pre><code>var activities = io('/activities');

activities.bind('created', function(activity) {
  // Add to the UI
});

activities.bind('updated', function(activity) {
  // Update the UI
});

activities.bind('deleted', function(activity) {
  // Remove from the UI
});

</code></pre>

<p>First we reference to the <code>activities</code> namespace using <code>io('/activities')</code> and then we bind to each event we’re interested in (<code>created</code>, <code>updated</code> and <code>deleted</code>). In each case we have as separate callback to handle each of those events which nicely separates our code into functional blocks.</p>

<p>The code really speaks for itself due to its simplicity. Although the activities example is used here I’m sure you can see how it maps to the web endpoints, requests/responses and logging examples that have been shown earlier.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post has discussed whether you need to analyse and process your real-time data and where you should do that. We’ve then looked at the importance of describing your data and how you can do that. Finally we’ve provided examples of publishing and then consuming your real-time data. From there it’s really up to you to start adding the real-time features – that were covered in the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/24/use-cases-for-your-realtime-data.html">real-time features and use cases</a> post – to your applications.</p>

<p>In this series we’ve covered <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/08/14/discovering-realtime-data-in-your-apps.html">identifying the real-time data</a> with your apps and systems, the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/25/describe-publish-consume-realtime-data.html">real-time features</a> you can build with your data and in this post we’ve covered <strong>how to describe, publish &amp; consume real-time data</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in digging into this a bit further I’ve recorded a screencast that covers some of the information from these posts entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk5Jm1IHxlI">You have real-time data. You just don’t know it.</a>. You can also find out more about strategies for dealing real-time data and real-time development best practices in a talk I gave at FOWA London, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPEcK4zFuyw">Tools, Tips &amp; Techniques for Developing Real-Time Apps</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the first part of our real-time data series. The second part in the series covers <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/24/use-cases-for-your-realtime-data.html">use cases for your real-time data</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/08/14/discovering-realtime-data-in-your-apps.html">Discovering Real-Time Data in Your Apps post</a> I covered <strong>what is real-time</strong> and <strong>discovering the real-time data</strong> within your existing apps. In this second post I want to cover ways in which you can use the real-time data that you have now identified within your apps. Specifically, how you can use that data to understand <strong>what’s happening right now</strong> in your apps and how it enables you to <strong>build awesome real-time features</strong> for your customers.</p>

<h2 id="whats-happening-right-now-in-your-apps">What’s Happening Right Now in <em>Your</em> Apps?</h2>

<p>It’s really important to know what’s happening in your application. The most common example of this is being notified if anything is going wrong; from infrastructure issues like CPU, memory or disk usage through to in-application warnings, errors and exceptions. These events are highly important as they may directly impact your business and customers.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/08/14/discovering-realtime-data-in-your-apps.html">first post in the series</a> we all now know that when any event takes place with an application there is an associated data payload and therefore real-time data. This information may be available in a number of ways, but one of the most common way is through some sort of logging solution: system stat logs, access logs and application logs.</p>

<p>Having logs let you analyse what has happened in the past, but that could be too late if your customers have been impacted by system downtime or a broken feature. Email notifications telling your team something is going awry are fine and are indeed useful. But there’s much more that you can do to act as things are happening or better still, before they’ve happened.</p>

<h3 id="real-time-system-analytics">Real-Time System Analytics</h3>

<p>There’s something reassuring about dashboards. A dashboard that’s showing the correct selection of information can give you a highly informative view of the status of your application. It lets you see what’s happened in the past and identify potential trends. Add real-time data and it lets you see what’s happening right now and enables you to be much more reactive to potential issues, or indeed opportunities.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/librato.png" alt="Librato stats" /></p>

<p>Many companies use <a href="https://www.librato.com/">Librato</a> to monitor a whole host of information; the status of the machines that make up our infrastructure, the number of persistent connections we’re maintaining, socket churn, the number of messages (events) we’re sending, system latency and much more. We of course have monitoring systems with pre-defined thresholds in place. But we also find that having a visual representation of what’s going on to be highly valuable for status updates, right after deployment to ensure unexpected things aren’t showing an unwanted upwards trend and during times when we’re trying to track down the cause of a problem.</p>

<p>You could use a solution like Librato, <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> or <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">statsd</a> for your system analytic dashboard, use a combination of these or build your own entirely. In some cases you could build your own real-time system analytics dashboard and deliver real-time data updates to it with <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">real-time web technology</a>.</p>

<h3 id="real-time-app-analytics">Real-Time App Analytics</h3>

<p>Most of us use some form of application analytics to identify how your application is being used, what features are most popular and which ones aren’t, if a promotional activity meet its goals and much more. Some analytics tools such as: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://clicky.com/">Clicky</a>, <a href="https://chartbeat.com/">Chartbeat</a> and <a href="https://www.gosquared.com/">GoSquared</a> offer real-time analytics. These let you know what users are doing right now in your app.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of the potential benefits of real-time analytics:</p>

<p>Has the usage of a feature – or the app as a whole – change just after pushing out a new version? Does it mean that a change has negatively impacted how accessible it is, or is there a chance something has broken? Real-time application logging and usage analytics will tell you.</p>

<p>You’ve just kicked off an advertising campaign with a goal to get more users to sign up. You can see a spike in website traffic, but your real-time analytics show you those visits aren’t converting to signups. You can instantly react by either tweaking the campaign (maybe the landing page) or cancelling the advertisement to save money.</p>

<p>You can either use one of these existing tools for your real-time analytics, or for a more customised approach you could try combining services like <a href="https://keen.io/">Keen IO</a> and a real-time web technology.</p>

<h2 id="building-awesome-features-for-your-customers">Building Awesome Features For Your Customers</h2>

<p>Although there’s clearly a benefit from using your new found data internally, the biggest benefits from a product and customer point of view are likely to be seen when you use that data to build new, exciting, productive and potentially interactive features for your applications.</p>

<p>So, how is real-time data generally used within applications? What are the most common use cases? Here are a few examples:</p>

<h3 id="signalling">Signalling</h3>

<p>When something has happened within one component or system and you need to instantly inform another component or system you can signal them. A signal can contain a data payload but it doesn’t necessarily need to/ The fact a signal has been received may be enough on it’s own; think lighting beacons across the hilltops to indicate an enemy is approaching.</p>

<p>In these use cases there may not be any visual indication that something is happening, but a new workflow may start following the signal.</p>

<p>Do you have real-time data within your systems that could be used to signal other processes to take place?</p>

<h3 id="user-notifications">User Notifications</h3>

<p>User notifications inform a user that something that they are interested in has happened or data relevant to them has changed. We’ve all seen the notification bar at the top of Twitter. ITV have used this to great effect on the live updates sections on <a href="http://www.itv.com/news">itv.com/news</a> where the notification bar is shown whenever an update arrives and when the user clicks the bar the new updates are shown in the app.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/itv-news-notification.png" alt="ITV News real-time notifications" /></p>

<p>Popup notifications are also a common UI pattern that are seen across many applications, from social apps like Facebook to more workflow focused applications like Freshdesk, InVision, Intercom, Base CRM and many more.</p>

<p>Is there data within your application that would benefit from being instantly displayed as a user notification?</p>

<h3 id="activity-streams">Activity Streams</h3>

<p>An Activity Streams is the quintessential representation of a real-time UI. They show what has happened and what is happening right now as a stream of sequential activity, normally with older activities at the bottom and newer activities at the top. We see these on all social networks; Twitter, Google+, Facebook, Flickr and many more.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/activity-streams.png" alt="Delighted Activity Streams" /></p>

<p>We also see Activity Stream UIs (sometimes referred to as an Activity Feed or News Feed) in news, sports and beyond; anywhere that there is a clear need to visualise activity. Live events are a great example. Whether it’s breaking news or a specific sporting event, you will see data represented as an activity stream with new updates appearing as they happen.</p>

<p>In all cases, a user is shown a stream of activity related to data that they are interested in. What have the people we are friends with, or are following, been doing and what are they doing right now? What has been happening with data related to my parcel? What user signups have taken place? What have the devices within my smart home doing? What’s the activity on a support ticket? etc. And what is happening related to those items right now?</p>

<p>Is there data within your system that would benefit from being displayed as an activity stream of actions, instantly updating as new activity takes place?</p>

<h3 id="data-visualisations--dashboards">Data Visualisations &amp; Dashboards</h3>

<p>Human beings can generally better extract information from data if it is displayed in a visual form – not just as simple text. We often seen visualisations that help us interpret historical information and the same practice can be applied to real-time data.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/nytimes-visualisation.png" alt="New York Times - Senate Elections Real-Time Visualisation" /></p>

<p>Adding real-time updates to a visualisation helps a user spot trends and changes in data that would be very difficult to spot through raw data alone. Seeing a dial move towards the green or red, a line starting to trend up or down, colours change on a map (such as in the New York Times example above), the area of a visualisation starting to grow or shrink or many more examples. All of these are great visual indicators and triggers that can help human beings be more aware of what’s happening, to identify changes and to act upon those changes as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Do you have data within your applications that would benefit from being converted into a real-time data visualisation to help you or your customers see trends and take action sooner?</p>

<h3 id="interactive-communication">Interactive Communication</h3>

<p>Real-time technology is frequently used to build chat and instant messaging solutions and we all know the benefit of being able to instantly communicate with work colleagues, friends and family.</p>

<p>Chat is a very focused form of interactions between users, but can be more generally thought of as interactive communication. We often partition chat into rooms or topics so that the conversation is focused.</p>

<p>In the context of your application, is there any real-time data that you could integrate into these conversations (chat/instant messaging) that would provide added context and help conversations become even more focused and productive? Could it actually trigger valuable conversations?</p>

<h3 id="multi-user-collaboration-beyond-chat">Multi-User Collaboration: Beyond Chat</h3>

<p>One of the core benefits of realtime technology, and technology in general, is to improve and automate workflows that involved multiple people. We’ve seen this with project management, support systems, stock management, logistics and even applications such as document writing where Google Docs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/collaboration.jpg" alt="Sprintly - Real-Time Collaborative Workflow" /></p>

<p>Collaborative applications save hours, if not days, when it comes to the time and effort required when working with others on completing a task or project. A great example of this is document collaboration: where previously we’d have to email a document around for others to make edits or comment we can now use Google Docs or Word in Office 365 to initially write a draft and then instantly start collaborating with others.</p>

<p>Real-time documentation editing is a very specific use case so you’re unlikely to be able to map the functionality it offers to the data you have (or maybe you can?). A more likely use case for your real-time data is to instantly send the changes in data to an application to inform your collaborators about what’s happening. Simple examples such as indicating that somebody else is editing a record can save time and avoid conflicts. Showing tickets in a project management system moving between stages in a workflow instantly indicates progress and can result in conversations or the next step in the workflow taking place.</p>

<p>Could you take your real-time data and improve your existing application workflows? Could you create visual representations of your workflows and enable real-time collaboration to further improve efficiency?</p>

<h3 id="real-time-apis">Real-Time APIs</h3>

<p>APIs are big news. They <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/apis-fuel-the-software-thats-eating-the-world/">fuel the software that’s eating the world</a>, they are <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/06/apis-are-the-new-ftes/">the new full time employees</a> of many businesses and they <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/09/apis-supercharge-your-ftes/">super-charge your existing employees</a>. So, where does your real-time data fit with the potential for offering a real-time API?</p>

<p>If you already have a real-time API then you can upgrade your API so that the initial <code>GET</code> requests also provide a mechanism for subscribing to future updates to the result dataset of that query. If you don’t have an API then you could expose the events you’ve identified within your systems as streams that other systems can subscribe to.</p>

<p>So, whilst you can build a new real-time feature on top of your real-time API, there’s the additional potential benefit of your customers now being able to get instant updates via an API and build their own applications and functionality on top of relevant data that you’re providing.</p>

<p>If you need more convincing you may be surprised to hear that a number of applications and services do already offer real-time APIs and they do so because they see a value in it. They know that companies want to add real-time features and experiences to their apps and they can only do that if they have real-time data.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/apps-with-realtime-apis.png" alt="Applications with real-time APIs" /></p>

<p>See the video covering this in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXgSFbphW88">so you want to build a Real-time API, where do you start?</a> talk.</p>

<h2 id="next-up-setting-your-real-time-data-free">Next up: Setting Your Real-Time Data Free</h2>

<p>In this post we’ve discussed the value of understanding what’s happening in your app right now and how you can expose your real-time data to help you get a much clearer understanding of that. We also looked at seven potential features (or even products) that you could build using your real-time data to make your product offering even more awesome; signalling, notifications, data visualisations and dashboards, interactive communication, collaboration and real-time APIs.</p>

<p>In the next post, <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/25/describe-publish-consume-realtime-data.html">describing, publishing and consuming real-time data</a>, we’ll take the next step: how do you take your real-time data and expose it in such a way that you can start building real-time features?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Real-time notifications, data visualisation, communication, collaboration… Whether the aim is to improve user experience or to facilitate the management of your infrastructure, the ability to collect, process, and deliver data in real-time is critical.</p>

<p>Every application has real-time data, but turning this data into useful functionality requires three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the points within a system where it can be found.</li>
  <li>Know how to make it accessible to other systems and applications.</li>
  <li>Understand how to consume and use the data within an application in order to build real-time features.</li>
</ol>

<p>During this series of posts on <strong>real-time data discovery</strong> I’ll show you how to identify the real-time data within your apps, give you some examples of what you can do with that data and finally I’ll provide some examples of how to do it. This series is based on a talk I’ve given so there’s also a “You have real-time data” screencast that we’ll share with the final post.</p>

<p>In this first edition I’ll prove to you that you do have real-time data in your apps and tell you where you can find it. If you’re asking yourself “What is Real-Time?” in the context of real-time web and Internet apps then first take a look at the <a href="/2016/04/22/what-is-realtime.html">What is Real-Time?</a> post.</p>

<p>With the background out of the way, let’s find that real-time data!</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-find-real-time-data">Where do you find Real-Time Data?</h2>

<p>Back in 2011 Mike Brevoort gave a number of talks with the title <strong>The Evented Web</strong>. In those talks he covered things like WebHooks, Comet and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a>. But in reviewing the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brevoortm/the-evented-web">slides</a> from these talks recently there were two that really stood out.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/call-you-406x300.png" alt="2011 Mike Brevoort - the Evented Web slide" />
<small><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brevoortm/the-evented-web">2011 Mike Brevoort – the Evented Web</a></small></p>

<p>This slide makes two very important points that are as relevant in 2015 as they were in 2011.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When something happens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something happening in a system is an <strong>event</strong>. An event is likely to have an associated data payload that contains information about what just happened.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll just call you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of having to ask a system to see if anything has happened, the system will instead tell the interested parties about it. It will <strong>push</strong> the event and associated data to other systems.</p>

<p>A few slides later Mike depicts a change taking place (in code) and the update being pushed to GitHub. GitHub then notifies a number of interested parties about that change; Jenkins CI for build, Boxcar for Push Notifications, Jira to resolve an issue and GAE for some custom functionality. These events are all triggered by a <strong>change</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/github-webhooks-403x300.png" alt="GitHub, WebHooks, Interactions &amp; Events - 2011 Mike Brevoort - the Evented Web" />
<small><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brevoortm/the-evented-web">2011 Mike Brevoort – the Evented Web</a></small></p>

<p>What these slides tell us is that if you can identify the events within your systems then you you’ve found real-time data. Additionally they tell us that events are caused by <strong>changes in data</strong> (in this case the code) and <strong>interactions</strong> (the push of the code to GitHub).</p>

<h2 id="events--changing-data">Events – Changing Data</h2>

<p>Applications are data-driven. They create data, display data, allow data to be updated and, in some cases, deleted. These operations are often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> which stands for <strong>C</strong>reate, <strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>U</strong>pdate and <strong>D</strong>elete and it’s quite easy to find these within your applications.</p>

<p>Of course, database interactions are also system interactions. But databases contain… well… data and any interaction with such a system has the high probability of representing a change in data. So it’s worth showing some specific examples.</p>

<p>Firstly you can look for any SQL statements:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO activities ...

UPDATE activities WHERE ...

</code></pre>

<p>NoSQL document interactions such as this <a href="https://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> example:</p>

<pre><code>var insertDocument = function(db, callback) {
   db.collection('activities').insertOne( {
      "text" : "Phil is talking"
   }, function(err, result) {
  });
};

</code></pre>

<p>Or any interactions with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM (Object Relational Mapper)</a></p>

<pre><code>Activity a = repository.GetActivity(10);
a.text = "Phil is still talking";
p.save();

</code></pre>

<h2 id="events--system-interactions">Events – System Interactions</h2>

<p>Next let’s take a look at some other, more generic, system interactions.</p>

<h3 id="web-endpoints">Web Endpoints</h3>

<p>Something that all web apps will have is a web endpoint. Whether to serve HTML content to users or as part of a Web API, each interaction represents an event with an associated data payload. Whether it’s Sinatra, Rails, Express, SailsJS, Flask, Django, Laravel, Silex, ASP.NET MVC … all of these frameworks provide ways of defining routes and web endpoints. Each interaction produces real-time data.</p>

<p>With Sinatra:</p>

<pre><code>post '/interact' do
  # endpoint called
end

</code></pre>

<p>Or Express:</p>

<pre><code>app.post('/interact', function(req, res) {
  // endpoint called
});

</code></pre>

<h3 id="requests--responses">Requests &amp; Responses</h3>

<p>If any web endpoint interaction is an interaction event then so is any request and response.</p>

<pre><code>var request = require('request');

var url = 'https://www.leggetter.co.uk';
request(url, function (error, response, body) {
  // response
});

</code></pre>

<p>The request event data has a URL and the potential for some payload depending on the type of request. The response event provides the result data. All real-time data as it happens.</p>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>We log information about what’s going on within our applications as it happens. We log it because it has some use. Not only historically, but also – for certain log levels – the instant that the log entry is created.</p>

<p>In Ruby using <code>logger</code>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'logger'
$LOG = Logger.new('log_file.log', 'monthly')   
$LOG.debug("I'm logging stuff!")

</code></pre>

<p>In Node using <code>winston</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var winston = require('winston');
winston.log('critical', errorEventPayload)

</code></pre>

<p>If we’re logging at <code>critical</code> then surely there’s much more value in getting that data now – in real-time – than there is grepping the logs after the event.</p>

<h3 id="many-more-system-interactions">Many more system interactions</h3>

<p>Web endpoints, request/response, logging, CRON jobs, incoming email… how about any form of I/O? Systems interactions are events that take place with a data payload that in some cases should be instantly distributed and exposed by other systems to use right away.</p>

<p>What other types of interaction are there?</p>

<h3 id="user-interactions">User Interactions</h3>

<p>User interaction events and associated data payload represent real-time data. A user navigating a website is ultimately a browser interacting with a web endpoint. But there is additional data associated with that interaction; the user data. In a SPA (Single Page App) a user navigating views, clicking the UI, moving the mouse, touching the screen, dragging, typing; each an interaction, each with not only the action data, but also the user data to give much richer context.</p>

<p>When users communicate with each other it is a clear real-time interaction – <em>@mentioning</em> being a good example. However, other actions like commenting on a post is an action where other users may want to know about that comment quickly in order to change the experience into a conversation. A user updating data that others are interested in becomes an event that results in user-to-user interactions.</p>

<h2 id="you-have-real-time-data">You Have Real-Time Data</h2>

<p>Real-time data discovery in your apps is actually pretty easy. If you weren’t convinced that you had real-time data within your apps when you started reading this blog post, I hope you are now. If you have events in your web apps, there are changes in data, or there are any interactions between components and systems then <strong>you do have real-time data</strong>. And now you know where you can find it!</p>

<h2 id="next">Next</h2>

<p>In the next post of this series I cover what you can do with the real-time data that you already have; from using the data to understanding what’s going on in your systems right now to building awesome real-time features for your users.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><small>This was originally written by me and published on the <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/what-is-real-time/">Pusher blog</a></small></p>

<p><strong>What is Real-Time?</strong> – it’s a question that is asked a lot. It’s a fundamental question that I’m sure many are curious to get a definition for. And many a developer that’s worked with embedded systems may have even been annoyed when they hear “real-time” in the context of the Web or the Internet applications. So, to clarify things once and for all let’s address the question of “What is Real-Time?” and apply it to the context of Web and Internet applications.</p>

<p>There are three types of real-time system and application classification: hard, firm, and soft.</p>

<h2 id="hard-real-time">Hard real-time</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hard Real-Time: missing a deadline is a total system failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Star Trek, the Starship Enterprise uses a warp core as the main energy reactor. The safety system for the warp core needs to identify potential problems within a finite amount of time. If it doesn’t then it’s <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Saucer_separation">saucer separation</a> time, or worse!</p>

<p>That is, the time between a problem occurring within the warp core and the safety system knowing about it has a <strong>hard deadline</strong> or there is a significant system failure. That’s <strong>Hard Real-Time</strong>.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t use <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/">real-time web technologies</a> as part of the Enterprise safety system. But you might use them in a hard real-time system if the deadline is sufficiently long and if the real-time technology offers some form of guaranteed delivery (simple receipt acknowledgement may suffice).</p>

<h2 id="firm-real-time">Firm real-time</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firm Real-Time – infrequent deadline misses are tolerable, but may degrade the system’s quality of service. The usefulness of a result is zero after its deadline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trading and betting systems are good examples of firm real-time systems. The important thing with these systems is that they are aware that messages may arrive outside of the deadlines and offer appropriate logic to deal with it. For example, if a user executes a trade on a given price you can’t absolutely guarantee that the “trade now” message will hit the trading system by the deadline so you need a mechanism to inform the user that a firm deadline was missed.</p>

<h2 id="soft-real-time">Soft real-time</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft Real-Time – the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline, thereby degrading the system’s quality of service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of real-time applications that we use fall into this category. Twitter, Facebook, any form of real-time chat, Google Docs, Uber and many more. Quite how much the “usefulness degrades” and what impact that has really depends on the application. A delayed document update in Google Docs reduces the user experience and can potentially result in duplicate/wasted effort. Missed Uber taxi position updates might result in a delayed journey or extra effort required to locate the exact taxi position.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-apply-to-real-time-web-mobile-and-iot-applications">How does this apply to Real-Time Web, Mobile and IoT Applications?</h2>

<p>Classifying your real-time apps – Web, Mobile, IoT or Star Trek systems – as hard, soft or firm is worthwhile for a couple of reasons. Firstly, you will be in a better position to explain yourself when confronted by folks who have a strong opinion about the use of “real-time” in applications. Secondly, and most importantly, it’ll make you think about the deadlines you should impose on the real-time data within your systems and how the applications that use that data should behave.</p>

<p>If you are building a real-time application and using the Internet as your communication network then you can really only think in terms of <strong>firm</strong> or <strong>soft</strong> real-time apps.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-real-time-answered-where-next">“What is Real-Time?” Answered! Where next?</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve clarified and classified the types of real-time and addressed the “What is Real-Time?” question we can finally move on to things like <em>discovering the real-time data</em> within our systems and apps and then <em>understanding the potential uses of that real-time data</em> to increase our knowledge of what are applications are doing <em>right now</em> and building real-time features that improve our product.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When I <a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter/status/685484634835148800">tweeted my availability</a> back on January 8th 2016 I wasn’t sure if it would have any reach. But thanks to an amazing network of peers, and a popular post on <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html">Defining Developer Relations</a>, I’ve ended up having lots of conversations with very smart people about potential opportunities.</p>

<p>As I reflected on the past year, and discussed developer relations with others, it became very clear that I had some criteria for my next role:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Key stakeholder in shaping the developer relations strategy</li>
  <li>Part of that strategy would need to include the ability to provide feedback from developers into the product</li>
  <li>Real-time technologies should still be relevant so that all the work I’ve done to date could (to some degree) be built upon</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.nexmo.com"><img src="/images/nexmo.png" alt="Nexmo logo" /></a></p>

<p>So I’m very excited to be joining <a href="https://nexmo.com">Nexmo - a cloud communications platform</a> - as Head of Developer Relations. Nexmo are a global communications company with offices all over the world. Their head office in London, UK.</p>

<p>## DevRel Team</p>

<p>Nexmo have had a small developer relations team for quite some time and I’m very much looking forward to working with their long-time Evangelist/Advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/tjlytle">Tim Lytle</a> and iOS DevRel Sidharth Sharma who is presently part-time, but hopefully moving to full-time soon. I’ve known Tim since 2010 so it’s great to finally have the chance to work with him in particular.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I’m joining Nexmo in 2016 is that they are growing their team in order to build better relationships with developers.</p>

<p>With that in mind I’m very pleased that <a href="https://twitter.com/sammachin">Sam Machin</a> will also be joining the developer relations team. Sam has been working with communications technologies for years and is always building inspiring prototypes. His <a href="http://sammachin.com/the-10-echo/">$10 Alexa using the Amazon Alexa API + CHIP</a> was a recent highlight.</p>

<p>As well as Sid joining us full-time in the near future we also hope to be growing the team further during 2016.</p>

<h2 id="devrel-plans">DevRel Plans</h2>

<p><img src="/images/plan.jpg" alt="Plan: Laptop and notebook." /></p>

<p>One of my first tasks in this new role is to work with the team to define a developer relations strategy. Since that strategy isn’t fully defined yet (today is my first day) I can’t say exactly what the team will be doing.</p>

<p>However, based on the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html">AAARRRP Framework</a> (from the Defining Developer Relations post) and my criteria for a role, I can confidently say that there will be a product and community focus to the activities we undertake.</p>

<p>Nexmo have some amazing customers including Airbnb, Expedia, Fitbit, GitHub, Snapchat and WhatsApp. These customers are using Nexmo because it’s a great service with fantastic products. The job of the developer relations team will include raising awareness of Nexmo’s products within developer communities and work with those communities to make sure these products solve problems for them in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<p>By solving real problems for developers, and by capturing their feedback, it will help Nexmo improve their existing products and build even better products in the future.</p>

<h2 id="future-communications-products">Future Communications Products</h2>

<p>Nexmo is a communications platform and that naturally aligns with my technology and use case interests. They offer APIs that let you build interactive functionality into applications through <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/products/sms/">SMS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/products/voice/">Voice</a> and via their <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/products/chat-app/">Chat App</a> integrations with numerous messaging providers such as WeChat and Viber.</p>

<p>In the future Nexmo will also offer other communications focused products that continue to furtehr align with my real-time technology interests.</p>

<h2 id="twilio">Twilio</h2>

<p>There’s no point in hiding it - we are competing with Twilio.</p>

<p>I started in an evangelist role in 2011. At the time my only developer relations connections were <a href="https://twitter.com/amit">Amit Jotwani</a> (Mashery), <a href="https://twitter.com/timfalls">Tim Falls</a> (SendGrid) and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevegraham">Stevie Graham</a> (Twilio). Stevie was one of the first SaaS product evangelists in the UK (if not Europe) and he lead the charge for Twilio in Europe. Over the years I’ve learnt a lot from him, from Rob Spectre (Director of Evangelism at Twilio), I’ve spoken at TwilioCon and have built a great relationship with folks at Twilio.</p>

<p>Twilio are also the reference when it comes to evangelism for SaaS and beyond.</p>

<p>This is scary and exciting. It’s scary because Nexmo does have a competing <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/#Products">set of communications products (SMS, Voice, 2FA, Chat API etc.)</a> and Twilio have an existing awareness within many developer communities. But it’s also really exciting because if developer relations can help Nexmo I believe it will demonstrate the value of DevRel in the communications API space and beyond.</p>

<p>It’s pretty obvious that we’re going to have to approach developer relations differently. I’m particularly excited about that.</p>

<h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>

<p>One of the things I will do is share the approach we take to Developer Relations at Nexmo. One of my mottos is <strong>Learn. Create. Share.</strong> and I see sharing this process as important as sharing ideas on technology.</p>

<p><img src="/images/share.jpg" alt="Phil Leggetter sharing ideas at BattleHack Tokyo. Learn. Create. Share" /></p>

<p>I’m sharing right now, I’ll do this with our initial planning phase and the use of the AAARRRP framework, into the ways we improve existing and new products based on developer feedback, to the metrics we gather and how we’ve measured the success of DevRel. I’m very much looking forward to planning our alpha/beta product programmes.</p>

<p>From the conversations that I’ve had over the past two month I’m hopeful that sharing these stories will be of interest to other companies and individuals involved in Developer Relations.</p>

<p>Please do let me know if there’s anything you’d specifically like me to share. Always happy to jump on a call too.</p>

<h2 id="getting-in-touch">Getting in touch</h2>

<p>You can always reach me on my personal email, but for anything Nexmo related please reach out via <a href="mailto:leggetter@nexmo.com">leggetter@nexmo.com</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/devrelometer.png" alt="Defining Developer Relations thumbnail" style="float: right; margin: 20px;" /></p>

<p>The number of companies looking to build developer relations teams is on the increase. But what developer relations means to each company tends to differ; some hire advocates and some hire evangelists, some are looking to market to developers and others see devrel as key to capturing feedback and to the success of their product. How do you know the roles and activities that will work best for your company? What’s the difference between these job titles?</p>

<p>What developer relations should mean to a company really depends on what the company’s goals are. For illustrative purposes let’s refer to the Google and Twilio developer relations mission statements, but <em>please remember that a small statement can’t fully reflect everything that their teams actually do</em>.</p>

<p>Google and Twilio missions statements suggest different approaches to developer relations:</p>

<h3 id="at-google">At Google:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developer Relations’ role is to create a vibrant ecosystem of 3rd party developers, by being the interface between those developers and your platform’s product, engineering, and design teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><small>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/google-developers/why-do-we-pay-these-people-anyway-d7ed706d6d55#.438f1qn4x">What is Developer Relations? - from Why Do We Pay These People Anyway*?</a></small></p>

<h3 id="at-twilio">At Twilio:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our job is to inspire and equip developers to build the next generation of amazing applications. This means understanding what they are trying to do, pointing them to tools and training and generally helping them be successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><small>Source: <a href="http://ahoy.twilio.com/heroes">Devangelism at Twilio - from Twilio Heroes</a></small></p>

<p>Google’s use of “the interface between” suggests two-way communication between product decision makers and developers using the product. Twilio’s approach suggests more of a one-way educational role in order to help developers use Twilio products.</p>

<p>Michael Mahemoff recently wrote <a href="http://softwareas.com/developer-relations-a-five-level-maturity-model/">Developer Relations: A Five-Level Maturity Model</a>. In the article he provides a set of levels of maturity for developer relations at a company; from having no devrel through to being able to fully quantify the value of their strategy.</p>

<p>In the context of defining a company’s approach to developer relations we can make a few adjustments to Michael’s definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>None</strong> - No promotion, support or product feedback capture</li>
  <li><strong>Informal</strong> - some developer relations handled by other functions. PR may be promoting the platform, business development may be partnering with and supporting developers. Developers may give technical talks in the community.</li>
  <li><strong>Partnerships</strong> - often stealthy, relations with prized partners (i.e. large, established, companies or those with sufficient resources to build showcases for new features).</li>
  <li><strong>Evangelism</strong> - Promoting, explaining, and supporting the platform at scale via conferences, partnerships, and online media.</li>
  <li><strong>Advocacy</strong> - A 2-way relationship in which the platform’s own staff sees themselves as not just advocating for the platform, but as advocating for developers using the platform. Feedback on bugs and feature request, and building supporting tools to improve the developer experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above - and again for illustrative purposes only - Twilio may approach developer relations as <strong>Evangelism</strong> and Google as <strong>Advocacy</strong>. Michael flags<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> that the right approach depends on the company’s goals for their devrel programme and this is clearly correct. For example, if a company wishes to focus on promotion and awareness, or potentially keep costs down by participating in fewer activites, then they may decide to focus on evangelism. If a company prioritises gathering product feedback from developers then advocacy may be the better approach.</p>

<p>Developer relations has the potential to help in many areas of the business, so it’s important to determine what goals you have for your strategy. Dave McClure’s <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version">AARRR metrics</a> can be used as a basis to indicate where and how a devrel strategy can help.</p>

<p>However, I’m going to suggest we make two changes to this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since developer relations also raises <strong>awareness</strong> of a product to developers, in a more traditional marketing sense, an additional “A” has been prefixed to this acronym.</li>
  <li>In some cases developer relations activities may cross over with what some may consider product. To indicate this involvement in <strong>product</strong> a “P” has been added as a suffix.</li>
</ol>

<p>These additions result in a new <strong>AAARRRP</strong><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> acronym. Instead of thinking of these as just metrics (although how they can be measured should be taken into consideration - see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5uinqFfl7w&amp;feature=youtu.be">What’s the ROI of Developer Relations</a>) think of them as potential goals for your developer relations programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Awareness</strong> - awareness of the platform and what it does</li>
  <li><strong>Acquisition</strong> - sign-up/download/install</li>
  <li><strong>Activation</strong> - actively using the platform in an application</li>
  <li><strong>Retention</strong> - continue to use the platform, use of new/additional features and use in new apps</li>
  <li><strong>Revenue</strong> - pay to use the platform</li>
  <li><strong>Referral</strong> - tell others about the platform</li>
  <li><strong>Product</strong> - involvement in building and getting feedback on product</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a wide and varied set of activities that may fall under developer relations. Each of these may align with one or more attributes of a programme that fulfill one or more AAARRRP goals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing documentation (<strong>acquisition</strong>, <strong>activation, product</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>Reference</li>
      <li>Guides (How to)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Library development (<strong>activation, product</strong>)</li>
  <li>Quick start apps (<strong>activation, product</strong>)</li>
  <li>Blog posts (<strong>awareness</strong>, <strong>acquisition</strong>, <strong>activation</strong>, <strong>retention</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>Tutorials</li>
      <li>Hacks</li>
      <li>Thought leadership</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Webinars (<strong>awareness</strong>, <strong>acquisition</strong>, <strong>activation</strong>, <strong>retention</strong>)</li>
  <li>Event sponsorship (<strong>awareness</strong>, <strong>acquisition</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>Meetups sponsor</li>
      <li>Conference booth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Talks (<strong>awareness</strong>, <strong>acquisition</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>Meetups</li>
      <li>Conferences</li>
      <li>Societies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support (<strong>activation</strong>, <strong>retention, product</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>User support system e.g. Zendesk</li>
      <li>StackOverflow</li>
      <li>Other forums e.g. <a href="https://laracasts.com/discuss">Laracasts Discuss</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pre-sales technical discussions (<strong>acquisition</strong>, <strong>activation</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>Calls</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Support</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dedicated forum e.g. Google Groups or Discourse e.g. <a href="https://community.smartthings.com/">SmartThings Community</a> (<strong>activation</strong>, <strong>retention</strong>)</li>
  <li>Alpha/Beta programmes (<strong>retention, product</strong>)</li>
  <li>Office Hours (<strong>activation</strong>, <strong>retention</strong>)</li>
  <li>Capture developer feedback (<strong>retention, product</strong>)</li>
  <li>Help company recruitment (<strong>awareness</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Successfully undertaking any of these activities results in having a positive impact on somebody, relationships will be forged and trust in the company representative and company itself will increase. This can then increase the likelihood of <strong>referral</strong>. But these <strong>relationships</strong> will take time to build.</p>

<p><strong>Revenue</strong> is an obvious omission from any of the above activities. Revenue is likely related to the level to which a developer uses a product. Therefore it relies on pricing structure. This can’t be generically fed into the above list of activities, but it certainly can help you focus on the activities or target developers that are likely to provide a larger ROI.</p>

<p>Although I personally don’t believe that anybody is defined by their job title, a job title in developer relations can help clarify what a company and other developers can expect of a person in a devrel role.</p>

<p>So, based on the most common job titles what activities do these different roles take part in?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer advocates</strong> may undertake all of the above activities as part of their developer relations programme. In particular see activities marked with <strong>product</strong> or <strong>retention</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer evangelists</strong> may focus much more on activities that result in acquisition such as docs, blog posts, event sponsorship and talks. See activities flagged to help <strong>awareness</strong> and <strong>acquisition</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>So, how do you define developer relations and what’s the best approach for your company? Here’s my suggestion:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the goals that you have for the developer relations team based on AAARRRP (Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Refferal and Product)</li>
  <li>Determine the activities that best align with those goals</li>
  <li>From those activities you can determine whether you’re looking for Developer Evangelists or Developer Advocates</li>
</ol>

<p>As an additional way of helping myself and others clarify - or at least suggest - an approach to this ongoing role naming debate I’ve built the <strong>DevRelOMeter</strong>. Based on the activities you wish your developer relations team to undertake it will suggest whether they will be practicing <strong>Evangelism or Advocacy</strong>.</p>

<section class="devrelometer">
  <header>
    <h2 id="devrelometer"><a href="#devrelometer">DevRelOMeter</a></h2>
    <p>Are you practicing - or considering practicing - Developer <strong>Evangelism</strong> or <strong>Advocacy</strong>?</p>
  </header>
  <section class="activities" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <ul id="activities"></ul>
  </section>

  <section class="half" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <div id="gaugeChart" class="epoch gauge-large"></div>
  </section>
  <section class="half" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <div id="pie" class="epoch"></div>

  <script>
  jQuery(function() {
    jQuery('#activities li').css('width', '380px');
  });
  </script>
</section>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2015/12/18/real-time-data-fundamentals.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2015/12/18/real-time-data-fundamentals.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/">lots of real-time frameworks</a> which exist to allow us to build real-time features and functionality into our apps. However, I often see developers who are excited about discovering real-time framework X and then proclaim “now to find a use for it”. Every single application has real-time data and every single application could benefit from real-time features driven by that data.</p>

<p>So I felt compelled to write a series of posts covering some of the fundamentals of real-time. This is complimentary with the series I previously wrote on <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/12/09/choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html">choosing your real-time web app tech stack</a>. If anything, this new series should be read first.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/04/22/what-is-realtime.html">What is real-time</a> - understanding what “real-time” means in the context of web, mobile and IoT applications</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/08/14/discovering-realtime-data-in-your-apps.html">Discovering the Real-Time Data in Your Apps</a> - helping you identify where you can find the real-time data in your apps and systems</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/24/use-cases-for-your-realtime-data.html">Using Your Real-Time Data: Use Cases &amp; Features</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2017/05/25/describe-publish-consume-realtime-data.html">How to Describe, Publish &amp; Consume Real-Time Data
</a> - how to easily share the data you’ve found and consume it within your applications in order to build real-time features</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m really pleased by this series of posts. I believe they cover some of the fundamentals that have been missing up until now. Every application does have real-time data and with that data you can then build features such as real-time notifications, activity streams, data visualisations, dashboards, interactive communication features such as chat, multi-user collaboration or even expose the data via a <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/5-reasons-you-should-have-a-real-time-api/">real-time API</a>.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your feedback on this real-time fundamentals series. So don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=real-time data series">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>So, you want a real-time API. Where do you start?</strong></p>

<p>You’re convinced of the benefits of a real-time API and know what data you want to make available through it. But you’ve probably got a number of questions playing on your mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What method do I use to expose the data?</li>
  <li>Do I increase the allowed polling interval of my REST API? (<em>Please don’t</em>) or offer HTTP Long-Polling, HTTP Streaming and/or WebSocket API endpoints?</li>
  <li>Or should I offer WebHooks?</li>
  <li>What format should my data be in?</li>
  <li>Are there any tools like <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> for real-time to help?</li>
  <li>Are there any real-time frameworks built with APIs in mind?</li>
  <li>And how do I go about scaling a real-time API?</li>
</ul>

<p>In this talk I gave at API Strat Berlin as part of the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/sessions/architecture-microservices/">Architecture, Scalability, and Microservices</a> session, I hope you’ll have a much clearer picture of where to start when building your real-time API.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I like retrospective-style posts. When writing them I get to look back at the things I’ve done and am often surprised, pleased and encouraged to improve. I also enjoy reading retrospective posts of others, particularly from those who are doing similar things or those that I look up to and learn from.</p>

<p>Hopefully the majority will forgive the indulgence of a personal retrospective and a few - like me - will find it interesting and useful. If you’re considering a developer evangelist role this may provide you with some insight. If you’re already working in a similar role then it might be a useful comparison. I’ll also do a <a href="#retro">summary retrospective</a> including a few stats, and cover what some my <a href="#q2-plans">plans are for 2015 Q2</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/stickers.jpg" alt="Phil Leggetter - Pusher Business card and stickers" /></p>

<p>So, what have I done in the first quarter of 2015 since <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/07/04/leaving-pusher-what-next.html">rejoining Pusher</a>?</p>

<h2 id="6-talks">6 Talks</h2>

<p>When you have an evangelist-style role you tend to commit quite far ahead to involvement in events. So, when you change jobs you can end up with commitments that don’t fully align with the new role. The fortunate side of this is that if you’re lucky you only commit to things you’re genuinely interested in. That was the case with me this quarter as I had a couple of talks related to <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">BladeRunnerJS</a>.</p>

<h3 id="large-scale-js--fed-london-in-january"><a name="fed-london">Large Scale JS @ FED London in January</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e9zHre5oBI"><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/leggetter-fed-london.png" alt="Phil Leggetter speaking at FED London" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>I was invited to talk at <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fed-london-sponsored-by-yahoo-registration-14767545125">FED London in January</a> to talk about building large scale JavaScript apps. It was at the Yahoo! offices in London at talks were also given on Atomic CSS, JavaScript transpilers and TypeScript.</p>

<p>It was a really well attended event and it was very interesting to speak to the Yahoo! engineers afterwards that were coming across the same <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>-based UI testing problems that I covered in part of my talk and that I <a href="https://vimeo.com/96430139">spoke about last year</a> at <a href="http://scotlandjs.com/">ScotlandJS</a>.</p>

<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e9zHre5oBI">Large Scale JS App talk</a> I gave at FED London.</p>

<h3 id="a-10-minute-guide-to-choosing-a-realtime-framework--forwardjs-san-francisco-in-february"><a name="realtime-guide">A 10 Minute Guide to Choosing A Realtime Framework @ ForwardJS, San Francisco in February</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://leggetter.github.io/realtime-tech-stack/fwd2-2015/"><img src="https://leggetter.github.io/realtime-tech-stack/fwd2-2015/img/realtime-web-solutions-updated.png" alt="10 Minute Guide to Choosing Your Real-time Framework Slides" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Back in 2013 I spoke at FOWA about <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2014/01/19/video-choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html">How to Choose Your Real-Time Web App Tech Stack</a>. It’s a talk that I’ve only given once and for those that give talks relatively frequently you’ll know it’s great to be able to reuse talks. Not just because so much time an effort goes into creating talks, but also because you get to incrementally improve the talk the more you give it.</p>

<p>So, I took the talk at <a href="http://forwardjs.com/forward2">ForwardJS 2</a> in San Franciso as an opportunity to look back at the 2013 talk, revise and condense the information into a <a href="https://leggetter.github.io/realtime-tech-stack/fwd2-2015/">10 minute guide on choosing a real-time framework</a>.</p>

<h3 id="you-have-real-time-data-you-just-dont-know-it--developer-week-san-francisco-in-february"><a name="realtime-data-sf">You Have Real-Time Data. You Just Don’t Know It. @ Developer Week, San Francisco in February</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P31lGHG_lL4"><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/you-have-realtime-goffice-record.png" alt="Phil Leggetter You Have Realtime Data - Recording from Office" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Since I started evangelism in 2010 I’ve always tried to be open in my evangelism of Real-Time technologies. The “choosing your real-time framework” talk demonstrates this. I’m continuing my personal crusade is to try and make as many people as possible realise that they do have use for real-time technologies within the applications they are building.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m specifically trying to emphasise that <strong>everybody has real-time data within their applications</strong>, how to identify that data and how it can be used.</p>

<p><a href="http://developerweek.com/">Developer Week</a> in San Francisco represented the first opportunity I had to talk about this topic. Since the talk wasn’t recorded I put together a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P31lGHG_lL4">video of the talk to send to attendees</a> afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="you-have-real-time-data-you-just-dont-know-it--cloudconf-turin-italy-in-march"><a name="realtime-data-turin">You Have Real-Time Data. You Just Don’t Know It. @ CloudConf, Turin, Italy in March</a></h3>

<p>Pusher were invited to send somebody along to <a href="http://2015.cloudconf.it/">CloudConf</a>. It’s great for us to be considered along with representatives from Google, Amazon, MongoDB, Red Hat, Digital Ocean, Twilio and many more.</p>

<p>I took the opportunity to continue my <em>You Have Real-Time Data Crusade</em> and you can see the slides from the event <a href="http://leggetter.github.io/you-have-realtime/cloudconf2015/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="large-scale-js--devweek-london-in-march"><a name="brjs-ldn">Large Scale JS @ DevWeek, London in March</a></h3>

<p>For probably the last time, I spoke about building Large-Scale JS apps. Since this was at DevWeek I went with the title <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/leggetter/patterns-and-practices-for-building-enterprisescale-html5-apps">Patterns and practices for building enterprise-scale HTML5 apps</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-you-should-be-using-web-components-now-and-how--devweek-london-in-march"><a name="web-components">Why You Should be Using Web Components Now. And How. @ DevWeek, London in March</a></h3>

<p>Having spent over a year evangelising building componentised web apps I’m naturally excited to see where Web Components are taking us. I started looking into Web Components in more detail when I wrote up <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2014/08/06/state-componentised-web.html">The State of the Componentised Web</a> in August 2014. I’m particularly interested in the software engineering benefits of building JavaScript applications out of components. How they naturally encourage encapsulation, re-use, functional cohesion and functional separation of concerns within apps.</p>

<p>This talk was recorded so I’ll post it as soon as I can. For now, here are <a href="https://leggetter.github.io/web-components-now/devweek-2015/">the slides</a>.</p>

<h2 id="event-attendance">Event Attendance</h2>

<p>I’m pretty terrible at going to events purely to attend. I feel particularly bad about this when amazing meetups like <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">TechMeetup</a> Edinburgh and Glasgow and JS events like <a href="https://twitter.com/edinburghjs">EdinburghJS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/glwjs">GlasgowJS</a> are only an hour’s drive away from where I live.</p>

<p>So far this year things haven’t really changed. But I did manage to make my way to a few events.</p>

<h3 id="php-uk-london-in-february"><a name="php-uk">PHP UK, London in February</a></h3>

<p>Everybody knows PHP has an interesting reputation - including everybody who uses PHP. I know Pusher is really valuable hosted service for those that are using PHP because it’s difficult to add real-time functionality to a PHP app sticking purely to using PHP. Pusher makes it easy to stick with PHP and still add real-time functionality to PHP apps. So, I wanted to know what was going on in the PHP community.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" align="center"><p>I wrote up some thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/phpuk15?src=hash">#phpuk15</a>.

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I really enjoyed the event and wrote up a post about how I found <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/php-2015-pragmatic-progressive-open/">PHP 2015 Progressive Hosted and Pragmatic</a> (see what I did there!).</p>

<h3 id="jquery-uk-oxford-in-march"><a name="jq-uk">jQuery UK, Oxford in March</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://jqueryuk.com/2015/videos.php?s=real-world-jquery"><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/ben-foxall-jquery-uk.png" alt="Ben Foxall at jQuery UK" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>jQuery is another framework that has an interesting reputation! But it’s used by so many of us that it’s not going away any time soon… it also fulfills lots of ongoing requirements when building web apps.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough there was very little talk of jQuery at the jQuery event. It was much more JavaScript and web development focused. Topics covered included tips on CSS from GitHub of <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">Mark Otto</a>, Web Components by <a href="https://twitter.com/supersole">Soledad Penadés</a> of Mozilla, What is the JS Event Loop by <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_roberts">Philip Roberts</a>, Security First by <a href="https://twitter.com/slexaxton">Alex Sexton</a> of Stripe, building resilient front-ends by <a href="https://twitter.com/andyhume">Andy Hume</a> from Twitter, Chrome Dev Tools updates by <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thisnatasha">Natasha Rooney</a> on ServiceWorker and an amazing <a href="http://jqueryuk.com/2015/videos.php?s=real-world-jquery">realtime (Pusher-assisted) multi-device demonstration by Ben Foxall</a>.</p>

<h3 id="londonapi-london-in-march"><a name="london-api">LondonAPI, London in March</a></h3>

<p><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/phil-nash-stevie-g.jpg" style="height: 220px; float: right; margin: 20px;" /></p>

<p>I was in London for my two talks at DevWeek so I took the opportunity to take in a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-API-Group/">LondonAPI</a> event.</p>

<p>I saw talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/philnash">Phil Nash</a> of Twilio on WebHooks, <a href="https://twitter.com/hpoom">Simon Wood</a> of Holiday Extras on HTTP/REST developer tools and my old mate <a href="https://twitter.com/stevegraham">Stevie Graham</a> on the really interesting tech/hacking behind <a href="https://twitter.com/tellerapi">Teller API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pusher-library-contribution"><a name="pusher-libs">Pusher Library Contribution</a></h2>

<p>I’ve missed the opportunity to work on SDKs. The Pusher Libraries are core to the developer experience at Pusher - it’s how developers interact with the service - so it’s great to be able to make changes, improve things and have those changes and improvements used by thousands of developers.</p>

<p>I’ve pushed new versions of the <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-dotnet">Pusher .NET HTTP library</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-php">PHP HTTP library</a>. I’ve done some refactoring of the <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-python/tree/1.0.0">new Pusher Python HTTP library</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-library-template">template</a> showing the recommended README and repo structure for Pusher libraries that interact with our HTTP API.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve been looking at the <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js">Pusher JavaScript</a> (browser-focused) library. It’s a nicely engineered library, but does need to be updated to reflect some modern JavaScript practices. Two things that <em>should</em> have been relatively easy are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Updating the tooling to be Node-based so we can take advantage of the mass of community solutions available.</li>
  <li>Add a <a href="https://github.com/umdjs/umd">UMD wrapper</a> with the main reason being so the library can be more easily used with amazing tools like <a href="webpack.github.io">webpack</a> and <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The need to continue to support IE7 is standing in the way of migrating all the tooling to Node - <em>we’ve found that there just isn’t a reliable Jasmine 1.3 Runner for Node with older browsers</em>. <strong>But</strong>, I’m very hopeful we’ll be able to get pusher-js into NPM with a UMD wrapper in the very near future since there is <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js/issues/84">demand for it</a>. What’s been holding us back is ensuring we can run our automated tests against the built library with the UMD wrapper.</p>

<h2 id="pusher-api-pitch"><a name="api-pitch">Pusher API Pitch</a></h2>

<p><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/api-pitch.png" style="float: right; margin: 20px; width: 175px" /></p>

<p>I’m really excited that we’re involved in <a href="https://2015.battlehack.org/">BattleHack 2015</a>. It’s been a while since I’ve been at a hackathon - too long.</p>

<p>Since Pusher are partners we’ll need to give an API pitch. So I’ve spent some time putting together an interactive slide deck for hackathons that gives an idea of what Pusher is, what you can build with it and let’s the Pusher evangelist write some code to show off just how easy it is to integrate Pusher into any technology stack.</p>

<h2 id="3-blog-posts--post-reviews"><a name="blog">3 Blog Posts + Post Reviews</a></h2>

<p>I love writing blog posts and tutorials so I’m disappointed to have only written one post per month over the last three months.</p>

<p>We recently made SSL available on all plans so I was involved in some of the planning behind that and wrote the <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/ssl-everywhere/">SSL Everywhere announcement post</a>. I also wrote up my <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/php-2015-pragmatic-progressive-open/">thoughts on PHP UK 2015</a>, that I mentioned earlier. Finally I eventually got around to writing up a <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2015/03/28/realtime-tech-predictions-review.html">Review of Realtime Web Tech Predictions from 2014</a> which was long overdue.</p>

<p>As well as this I’ve been fortunate to get to review and provide feedback on a number of Pusher blog posts. My favourites are <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/how-we-built-atom-pair/">How We Built AtomPair, Our Realtime Collaboration Plugin For Atom.IO</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiepatel">Jamie Patel</a>, the <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/pusher-battlehack-2015/">Pusher at BattleHack 2015 announcement</a> and most recently <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/porting-the-pusher-integration-tests-to-haskell/">Porting the Pusher integration tests to Haskell</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/willsewell_">Will Sewell</a> which was a great learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="stats--retrospective"><a name="retro">Stats &amp; Retrospective</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>305 minutes spoken for</li>
  <li>12 StackOverflow answers</li>
  <li>+500 email conversations participated in</li>
  <li>256 GitHub Commits</li>
  <li>7 trips &amp; 22 nights away (25% of the quarter)</li>
  <li>~15.5k miles travelled (16 flights, 23 Taxis, 1 train journey, 2 bus journeys)</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting up to speed when starting a new job take time. Going back to a similar job is a different experience. But Pusher is a different company to the one I <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/07/04/leaving-pusher-what-next.html">left back on 2013</a> so it took a little bit of time to get into the swing of things again.</p>

<p>Travel-wise, I’m relatively happy. I don’t think I’d want to be away from home more than 25% of the time. Especially since I’ve two kids of 3.5 years and 6 months who I want to be there for.</p>

<p>I’ve probably been involved in too many things at once which has resulted in getting a bit less done that what I would have liked.</p>

<p>That said, I’m pleased with my contribution in terms of real-time general knowledge sharing within the company, giving 6 talks whilst representing Pusher and my work on the Pusher libraries.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I really want to start writing more and following <em>my developer evangelist motto of Learn. Create. Share</em>. I also want to continue to improve the developer experience at Pusher.</p>

<p>It’s great to be back at Pusher and I’m very much looking forward to our upcoming roadmap week to define the rest of the quarter ahead.</p>

<h2 id="plan-for-q2-2015"><a name="q2-plans">Plan for Q2 2015</a></h2>

<p>I’m presently working on getting the <strong>Pusher JavaScript library into NPM</strong> with <a href="https://twitter.com/zimbatm">@zimbatm</a> and am hopeful that’ll be done very soon. From there I’ll be able to use tools like webpack and Browserify when I build demos. So, definitely more demos!</p>

<p><strong>More tutorials and blog posts</strong> are definitely on the cards. From showing how well Pusher integrates with a number of great technology stacks and services through to sharing knowledge on best-practice in using real-time technologies and apps.</p>

<p>I’m going to continue my crusade to make sure that as many people as possible know they have real-time data, know they have a use for a real-time framework or service and are inspired to build amazing real-time features into their existing or new applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://futureofwebapps.com/london-2015/"><img src="/images/2015-q1-retro/fowa-2015-realtime-tooling.png" style="float: right; margin: 20px; width: 200px" /></a></p>

<p>I’m excited about talking about the key points to consider when a business is about to embark of offering a Real-Time API at the end of this month at <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/sessions/architecture-microservices/">API Strat / API Days in Berlin</a>, 23rd to 24th April.</p>

<p>Something unrelated to Q2, but that I want to give a mention to, is that it’s great to be speaking again at <a href="https://futureofwebapps.com/london-2015/">FOWA London</a> this year. This time I’m going to give a talk on <strong>Tools, Tips and Techniques for Developing Real-time Apps</strong>.</p>

<p>In general, I’ll have a much better idea about what’s coming up after this week - Pusher roadmap week.</p>

<h2 id="closing-off">Closing Off</h2>

<p>For those that read this far - well done! I hope sharing this information either provides you with some insight into the type of things you would do in a developer evangelist role or if you are already working in developer evangelism/advocacy/relations you can compare it to what you’ve done and the things you’ve achieved so far this year.</p>

<p><strong>~Learn. Create. Share~</strong></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in February 2014 I wrote a list of <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2014/02/24/10-realtime-web-technology-predictions-for-2014.html">10 predictions for realtime web technologies in 2014</a> (well, it was 10 and 2 bonus items). In this blog post - sorry it’s not 1 year on - I’ll review those predictions and provide my thoughts on whether they were correct or not.</p>

<p>Here’s how I feel I did with the 10 predictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 Correct <span style="color:green;">✔</span></li>
  <li>3 Partially correct <span style="color:orange;">¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</span> There’s evidence to suggest trends towards 3 of the predictions so I’m only going to say I was partially correct with those.</li>
  <li>2 Incorrect <span style="color:red;">✘</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I was 50/50 with the additional 2 bonus predictions.</p>

<p>Before I dive in I wanted to cover my two highlights of 2014.</p>

<p>The biggest news of the year in the real-time space was <a href="https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html">Google’s acquisition of Firebase</a>. I didn’t predict this publicly, but I did actually ask <a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">James Tamplin</a> about this when I’ve met up with him in the past. I thought this was a possibility after Nest, who use Firebase for their API, was <a href="https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html">acquired by Google</a> for $3.2 Billion. I personally also think that mobile is a big part of Google’s decision since mobile developers tend not to want to deal with any infrastructure. Since Firebase offers login, persistence and security rules mobile devs don’t have to. This will get developers onto the Google Cloud Platform which Firebase is - or probably will be - incorporated into.</p>

<p>On a personal note I was very pleased to have <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2014/12/04/rejoining-pusher.html">rejoined Pusher</a>. Although I’d <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2014/01/19/video-choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html">spoken at FOWA</a>, Hackference (<a href="http://2015.hackference.co.uk/">2015 is coming</a>) and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/sotr/sctqhm/#link-zczb">Scotch on the Rocks 2014</a> about real-time technologies and written <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/build-real-time-app-socketio-11514083">an article on Socket.IO</a> for .NET magazine I was really missing being part of the real-time technology scene. It’s great to be a part of it again and it’s great to be back at <a href="https://pusher.com">Pusher</a>.</p>

<p>To the prediction reviews…</p>

<h2 id="1-realtime-all-the-apps---">1. Realtime All the Apps - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>realtime will become a fundamental part of a significant number of new mainstream applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_18986-150x150.png" alt="icon_18986" width="150" height="150" style="float:right; margin: 15px;" /></p>

<p>We saw lot’s more apps use real-time technology in 2014. 4 of the <a href="http://time.com/3582114/top-10-apps/">top 10 apps listed on time.com</a> offer realtime experiences including Facebook Rooms, WhatsApp, SnapChat and Uber. The first three are clearly notifications and chat the latter for real-time geolocation of taxis.</p>

<p>Apps that were probably already known of such as like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/31/slack-confirms-120m-fundraise-led-by-google-ventures-and-kpcb-at-1-12b-valuation/">Slack</a>, HipChat, Asana, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/quizup-localization/">QuizUp</a> and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/07/31/wunderlist-completely-rebuilt-bid-become-home-worlds-lists/">Wunderlist</a> saw significant growth - all offering highly real-time experiences.</p>

<p>Fantasy sports companies like DraftKings and FanDuel also saw <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/blog/techflash/2014/11/fanduel-vs-draftkings-are-we-seeing-the-future-of.html?page=all">growth in 2014</a>. Both of these companies rely on real-time technology to deliver the gaming experience that makes them so popular.</p>

<p>There were so many real-time social apps - with a significant number of them offering “Instant Messaging” - that I’m quite happy to say I got this one right.</p>

<h2 id="2-commoditization-of-realtime---">2. Commoditization of Realtime - <span style="color:red;">✘</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>realtime functionality will make its way into many existing frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real-time technologies had already made their way into stacks like <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/07/30/is-it-live.html">Rails</a> and <a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/10/01/announcing-faye-1-0/">ASP.NET (through SignalR)</a>, and solutions such as <a href="https://github.com/jonashagstedt/swampdragon">SwampDragon</a> came along for Django, but I didn’t see a particular surge of easy to use Server-Sent Events or WebSocket in new versions of <em>existing frameworks</em>.</p>

<h2 id="3-more-realtime-frameworks---">3. More Realtime Frameworks - <span style="color:red;">✘</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>an increase in the number of frameworks that are built on the foundation of realtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_8451-150x150.png" alt="icon_8451" width="150" height="150" style="float:right; margin: 15px;" /></p>

<p>From what I saw in 2014 I got this wrong. What I actually saw happen was existing frameworks further establish their dominance.</p>

<p><a href="http://faye.jcoglan.com/">Faye</a> and <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> gained in popularity, as did the existing and established real-time services such as Pusher, PubNub, Firebase and Realtime.co.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see GoInstant - who had been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/salesforce-com-reported-to-buy-goinstant-for-70-million/">acquired by Salesforce.com</a> for a serious sum - close down their service. This was another example that established players actually gained further adoption during 2014 and lesser known companies struggled with developer acquisition.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-power-of-collaboration---ツ">4. The Power of Collaboration - <span style="color:orange;">¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m very hopeful that we’re going to see increasing innovation in the collaboration space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main uses for real-time tech are still notifications (and signaling), activity streams (a set of notifications with history), real-time dashboards, visualisations and chat.</p>

<p>Although chat is a collaborative experience that offers significant UX and product value, it’s not a particularly innovative use of the technology; it’s not a new experience. I still really want to see more.</p>

<h2 id="5-realtime-apis---">5. Realtime APIs - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no reason why API providers can’t start exposing evented data via a realtime API.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I’m entirely honest, before I sat down to write this follow-up post I thought I’d got this one wrong. It’s not until you start to look at all the well-known services and APIs that you discover all those that are now offering real-time APIs of some kind; whether it’s WebHooks or streaming endpoints.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/apps-with-realtime-apis.png" alt="Realtime APIs" /></p>

<p>Obviously, some of the examples above have had real-time APIs for a while, whilst some of them are new.</p>

<p>The main interesting trend here is that it’s not just traditional API providers that are now looking to offer Real-Time endpoints. It’s also more traditional consumer-facing solutions that are also getting into real-time technology and APIs.</p>

<p>I do think we’re going to see even more growth here during 2015.</p>

<h2 id="6-even-more-webhooks---">6. Even more WebHooks - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re seeing many more uses of WebHooks and it makes sense that the usage is going to increase further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve just realised this is a bit of a cheat. Since the last prediction also covered a general increase in real-time tech for APIs, and WebHooks are most likely used within APIs, I kinda get this one for free.</p>

<h2 id="7-realtime-service-powered-apis---ツ">7. Realtime Service Powered APIs - <span style="color:orange;">¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>in order for API providers to facilitate point 5, “Realtime APIs”, I believe it’s highly likely that they will consider using existing Realtime Hosted API provides to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted at the start of this post, <a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/cloud/architecture-overview">Nest uses Firebase</a>. This is likely to be a dedicated Firebase instance, but it will most probably be an instance that’s managed by the Firebase team (this is what we do for large clients at Pusher).</p>

<p>The main area I’ve seen a lot of uptake in the use of hosted services as real-time API infrastructure is for Bitcoin. <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/websocket/">Bitstamp</a> and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API/Pubnub">MtGox</a> are two examples (although links from the second example seem to be broken now).</p>

<p>Then of course there’s <a href="https://fanout.io">Fanout</a> that although this service can help you “Build and scale realtime websites, apps, and APIs” seems well positioned for the the API space - infrastructure for your real-time APIs. Their performance will be a great indicator to see if this predication does <em>eventually</em> come true.</p>

<p>Communications API focused companies is another area that will likely start to see existing real-time infrastructure providers being utilised. <a href="https://www.sinch.com/">Sinch</a> is a good example; they’re actually a new company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/14/rebtel-spins-out-sinch-with-12m-in-funding-to-offer-communications-tools-to-developers/">spun out of Rebtel</a> and they use PubNub for signaling within their API.</p>

<p>So, I’m not going to claim this as wholly correct, but there is evidence that this is happening and I believe it will continue to do so.</p>

<h2 id="8-an-open-source-data-sync-solution---ツ">8. An Open Source Data Sync solution - <span style="color:orange;">¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m yet to find an open source solution that offers the same kind of data synchronisation functionality as Firebase or GoInstant. I’m hopeful that a solution we be along shortly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m cheating a bit here because I actually need to admit that I missed a bunch of existing solutions in this space in 2013. Two big ones are <a href="http://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> and <a href="http://sharejs.org/">ShareJS</a>. This is particularly embarrassing because, firstly I did know about these solutions and secondly I actually personally know <a href="https://twitter.com/daleharvey">Dale Harvey</a> who is a core contributor to PouchDB.</p>

<p>In addition to these I’ve also been contacted about <a href="https://github.com/lowla">Lowla</a> that’s still in early stages, but looks promising.</p>

<p>An interesting point to note in a related space is that PubNub did open up data sync functionality in beta during 2014. But the majority of the links to this feature on PubNub now either redirect or fail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=pubnub+data&amp;oq=pubnub+data&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i59.1437j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;gws_rd=ssl&amp;safe=strict#safe=strict&amp;q=pubnub+data+sync"><img alt="Where has PubNub Data Sync gone?" src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/pubnub-data-sync.png" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not sure if this is due to PubNub’s full product focus moving to “streams” or a lack of interest in another data sync solution. Does this, combined with the demise of GoInstant, suggest data sync doesn’t have the expected demand? I would think <a href="http://www.syncano.com/">Syncano</a> - a new BaaS - are betting on there still being big demand.</p>

<h2 id="9-the-death--revival-of-socketio---">9. The Death &amp; Revival of Socket.IO - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>With so many companies and individuals using Socket.IO I’m surprised that somebody hasn’t offered to sponsor development - or maybe they have, but it’s just not public knowledge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With so many companies and individuals using Socket.IO this was an easy prediction. It would seem that <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/cloudup-joins-the-automattic-family/">CloudUp being acquired by Automattic</a> was a catalyst for this as Socket.IO is now supported by Automattic and lives under their GitHub organisation.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/socketio-revival.png" alt="Socket.IO revival" /></p>

<p><a href="socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/">Socket.IO v1.0 was released</a> in May 2014 and there have been spikes of activity every now and again since then.</p>

<p>## 10. IOT &amp; Realtime - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2014 the usage of realtime web technology and IoT is going to skyrocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_28698-150x150.png" alt="icon_28698" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24292" /></p>

<p>What a year for the Internet of Things! Although I think this year will be even bigger. I don’t think I really need to write anything here to justify my opinion that I got this one right. It wasn’t a difficult prediction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some solutions to watch out for include SmartThings, Ninja Blocks and SkyNet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SmartThings was <a href="http://blog.smartthings.com/news/smartthings-updates/smartthings-samsung-open-platform/">acquired by Samsung</a> in August 2014 and <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/07/21/octoblu-launches-to-make-skynet-internet-of-things-tools-professional-grade/">SkyNet renamed to Octoblu</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismatthieu">Chris Matthieu</a> - who was behind SkyNet (as far as I’m aware) - is now Director of IoT Engineering at Citrix.</p>

<p>Ninja Blocks also seem to be doing pretty well with lots of partnerships.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/ninja-blocks-partners.png" alt="Ninja Blocks partners" /></p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://blog.ninjablocks.com/">Ninja Blocks blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-1-webrtc-audiovideo-and-data-channels---">Bonus 1: WebRTC Audio/Video and Data Channels - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A big deal has been made of WebRTC for audio and video communication. And it is a very big deal which will continue to result in lots of great apps using audio and video without the need to of costly infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2014 was jam-packed with apps - from hacks to products - with a focus on in-browser audio and video. These were mainly chat applications with quite a few of them focusing on helping remote workers communicate with each other; <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com/">sqwiggle</a>, <a href="https://appear.in/">appear.in</a> and <a href="http://talky.io">talky</a> were, and are, pretty popular. Twilio are also pushing pretty hard with their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/client/twilio-js">Twilio.js</a> client which uses WebRTC. We’ll see WebRTC used more and more on mobile in 2015 too.</p>

<p>I’m sure we’re going to see <a href="https://bloggeek.me/webrtc-data-channel-uses/">more done</a> with the data channels in the future.</p>

<p>We’ve also seen the emergence of companies like Sinch - who I mentioned earlier - and <a href="https://www.respoke.io/">respoke</a> that seem very focused on peer-to-peer audio, video and data connectivity over WebRTC.</p>

<p>## Bonus 2: Better Realtime Developer Tooling - <span style="color:red;">✘</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I expect logging, debugging and tooling of existing solutions to improve and I also hope that we start to see dedicated tooling being created to help realtime web application development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although there does seem to be a big increase in <a href="http://john-sheehan.com/blog/ultimate-api-webhook-backend-service-debugging-testing-monitoring-and-discovery-tools-list">tooling to help developers work with WebHooks</a> I was really hoping for improved tooling around HTTP Streaming, Server-Sent Events, WebSockets and in-browser developer tooling improvements. In my opinion this hasn’t happened.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion---">Conclusion - <span style="color:green;">✔</span></h2>

<p>I’m pretty confident and happy to say that I got 5 our of 10 Real-Time Web Technology predictions correct and that there are still signs that 3 of the other ones may happen.</p>

<p>The real-time technology space is strange in that it’s taking a comparatively long time for adoption to really pick up. The technology has been around for 15 or so years and even companies like Pusher have now been around for nearly 5 years. But the angle of inclination of the upwards curve is definitely increasing. I’m very much looking forward to see what happens in 2015 and beyond.</p>

<p>I may even talk and blog about it. And maybe provide some more predictions… <strong>If you’d like me to talk at your event about Real-Time Technology or write an article, please <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=Real-Time Tech Talk or Article">get in touch</a>.</strong></p>

      <title><![CDATA[Realtime Connection Transports]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2015/01/26/realtime_framework_connection_transports.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2015/01/26/realtime_framework_connection_transports.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Many tout WebSocket as a long awaited transport technology for realtime communication on the web. For many years developers have hacked around with HTTP to try and achieve “realtime push” (a.k.a. server push), where the server “pushes” data to the client. WebSocket was the solution that was born out of the requirement to provide a standardised solution to replace the hacks. But some solutions are still using HTTP transports such as <strong>Polling</strong>, <strong>Long-Polling</strong> and <strong>Streaming</strong>. So has WebSocket failed to live up to its promise?</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/what-came-before-websockets/">previous post</a> I go into mechanism for achieving HTTP transports. In this post I’ll take a look at why HTTP-based transports are still used by realtime frameworks and services, why all solutions don’t use WebSocket, and which transports are best for different realtime use cases.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-realtime">What is Realtime?</h2>

<p>When we talk about realtime in combination with web apps, mobile apps and IoT devices we mean something different to realtime in vehicle breaking systems or the USS Enterprise warp core safety system. The latter require hard realtime; when antimatter containment is lost that core needs to be ejected within a hard deadline or the ship is lost. Realtime on the web is generally soft; the usefulness of the data can degrade over time without system failure.</p>

<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3088/4561801219_a4199e3dea_b.jpg" alt="Warp Core Breach" /></p>

<p>So, you don’t want to control your warp core safety system using a realtime web framework. But there are still plenty of use cases and some of those can be business critical. You just need to be aware that you’re reliant on network infrastructure (the Internet) that you many not control to relay messages - and have appropriate fallbacks within your system.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering how fast are these realtime frameworks then? Based on the stats I’ve gathered from six hosted services the average of all those providers is around 380ms from a message being sent to it being delivered.</p>

<p>The use cases for the technology vary widely but can roughly be broken down in to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notifications &amp; Signalling</li>
  <li>Activity Streams</li>
  <li>Data displays</li>
  <li>Chat</li>
  <li>Second Screen experiences</li>
  <li>Live geolocation tracking</li>
  <li>Multi-user collaboration</li>
  <li>Multiplayer games</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we’ve covered a bit of background about the technology and how it’s being used let’s have a brief look at the history and current status of the realtime connection transports.</p>

<h2 id="http-long-polling--streaming-hacks">HTTP Long-Polling &amp; Streaming Hacks</h2>

<p>Many years ago - at least as far back as 2000 - there were a few companies that were doing all they could to work around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">request-response</a> limitations of HTTP. Those companies had a use case where they needed to <em>push</em> information from the server to one or more <strong>web browsers</strong> as soon as the data became available (this is way before IoT and connected devices were on anyone’s radar.).</p>

<p>In 2000 the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object didn’t exist within web browsers and the term <em>AJAX</em> hadn’t even been invented. Realtime Web pioneers would work around browser limitations with Java Applets (remember those?), FRAMES, IFRAMES, dynamically generated script tags, ActiveX controls and all number of hacks to try to maintain a long-held connection between client and server.</p>

<p>Even when the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object arrived it didn’t help because it started out being only available in IE (created for Outlook Web). Even when the other browsers adopted it, it wasn’t easy to maintain a persistent connection between client and server. Browser quirks and security limitations held realtime technology advancement, adoption and usage exploration back.</p>

<p><em>Note: For a more in-depth look at the types of hacks please check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet (Programming) Wikipedia page</a> and <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/what-came-before-websockets/">What came before WebSocket?</a>.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://images.kino.de/flbilder/max96/bf96/bf20_21/b9620021/w964.jpg" alt="Hackers" /></p>

<p>So we hacked! And hacked! And worked around the imposed limitations.. And this is why HTTP-based solutions like HTTP-Streaming and HTTP Long-Polling are traditionally hacks; they worked around protocol and browser limitations and restrictions; they did this in inconsistent ways and played on browser quirks to achieve the desired server-push functionality.</p>

<p><em>Note: If you’re also interested in a higher level background about how realtime went mainstream take a look at the <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/10/28/history-background-benefits-use-cases-realtime.html">History, Background, Benefits &amp; Use Cases of Realtime</a> part of my realtime web tech guide.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-still-use-http-transports">Why still use HTTP transports?</h2>

<p>If HTTP-based solutions are so “hacky” why do so many realtime solutions still use them? Remember those browser quirks? Well, <em>we now have standards!</em> The ways you would achieve in-browser HTTP Streaming and HTTP Long-Polling became standardised and much easier to achieve, no matter which browser is used.</p>

<p>So are HTTP Streaming and HTTP Long-Polling still hacks? These HTTP-based solutions are used in so many frameworks and there are use cases where they are a good fit. Specifically, when the majority of communication is from server to client (see <em>HTTP Shortcomings</em> below).</p>

<p>In fact you could considered HTTP Streaming and Long-Polling as standardised as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-Sent Events</a>. All browsers <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource">other than IE</a> presently offer an <code>EventSource</code> API within the browser.</p>

<p>Looking at the glass half full, HTTP does work everywhere. Proxies and firewalls understand HTTP and know how to work with it. There are still pieces of network infrastructure that don’t like long-held connections so we do still need Long-Polling and even standard polling right now.</p>

<p>WebSocket, on the other hand, is still a comparatively new technology with <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets">great browser support</a> that is unfortunately hindered by ageing network infrastructure that <em>also gets in the way of progressive HTTP connectivity</em>. Not only that, but the WebSocket protocol went through a number of revisions on the way to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>. And, because the process was quite a long one, there are a number of clients that are using older incompatible versions of the protocol. As a result, solutions that support WebSocket ideally should support these older protocol versions.</p>

<p>A final reason why frameworks and services may still be using HTTP over WebSocket is that you still need polling and at least some sort of long-polling and streaming for those scenarios where a WebSocket connection can’t be established. This means that frameworks or services must have some form of connection management and strategy to support failover between connection transports. Managing the ability to connect over HTTP and WebSocket within a framework, service and supporting libraries can be complex: some opt to stick with HTTP only, although <em>nearly</em> all major services and frameworks now offer WebSocket and HTTP connectivity.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the complexity of multi-transport connection management in Pusher’s post on <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/pusher-2-0-0-cutting-edge-websockets-with-comprehensive-legacy-support/">adding HTTP fallback</a> to compliment their WebSocket-focused service.</p>

<h2 id="http-shortcomings">HTTP Shortcomings</h2>

<p>If you decided to read <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/what-came-before-websockets/">what came before WebSocket article</a> before reading this far you already know why HTTP falls short. For those that didn’t read that article it’s pretty simple: HTTP supports the request-response cycle so you can initially send data to the server. But once the server has initiated the response the client can’t send any additional information to it over that same connection. You can think of the initial request as a kind of handshake and from that point on it’s essentially a uni-directional communications channel from server to client. Even with Keep-Alive where the underlying TCP connection can be reused between requests and HTTP Pipelining <strong>you can’t achieve bi-directional communication over a single persistent HTTP connection</strong>.</p>

<p>Why does any of this matter? As we start to build applications with more interactive functionality we’re going to see a dramatic increase in the communication that takes place between client and server. Realtime technologies will be fundamental to supporting that level of communication whilst maintaining a great user experience. Underpinning all of this will be the requirement to provide bi-directional communication support over a single efficient connection.</p>

<p><strong>And that’s why we need WebSocket.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-websocket">Why we need WebSocket</h2>

<p>The main purpose of WebSocket is to provide a standardised way to solve all the problems we get with HTTP.</p>

<p>A WebSocket connection is a single bi-directional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_%28telecommunications%29#Full-duplex">full-duplex</a> connection between the client and server. The protocol itself is also much less verbose than HTTP resulting in smaller message payloads. The bi-directional full-duplex connectivity along with the <strong>smaller payloads</strong> results in <strong>lower latency</strong> messaging and more <strong>efficient connections</strong><sup>†</sup>. In a world where increasingly content is being consumed over mobile devices, this will directly impact customer satisfaction, thanks to increased battery life, lesser usage of the data plan, speed, etc. As a result, WebSocket is becoming the must have transport in any realtime framework or service.</p>

<p><em><sup>†</sup> See <a href="#additional_reading">Additional Reading</a> for more justification on the above statements.</em></p>

<h2 id="transports--their-most-suited-realtime-uses-cases">Transports &amp; Their Most Suited Realtime Uses Cases</h2>

<p>Finally, I’d like to provide some information on where I believe the available realtime transports are most suitable. I’ll do this based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Message frequency</strong> - how often messages should be sent</li>
  <li><strong>Bi-directional</strong> - support for two-way communication over a single connection</li>
  <li><strong>Message latency</strong> - latency between the message being published and delivered</li>
  <li><strong>Connection efficiency</strong> - data over the wire and general resource usage on client and server</li>
  <li><strong>User experience</strong> - appropriate usage to maintain a reasonable user experience</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll then provide the most appropriate use case for each of the realtime connection transport types.</p>

<h3 id="http-polling-short-polling">HTTP Polling (Short-Polling)</h3>

<p>HTTP Polling is fine for updates that don’t need to be delivered quickly <em>and</em> where updates happen infrequently. As frequency of polling increases, so does the load on the server and strain on the client. You can use the request to send data to the server and the response to get the fresh data. However, this means client data must be queued until the next request is sent. Each request outside of the polling cycle results in an additional connection.</p>

<p>Along with being inefficient, the user experience is impacted if the data within the application needs to maintain context. If the data is delivered late then it’s of no use to the user of the app.</p>

<p>HTTP Polling is therefore suitable for lots of use cases where the data doesn’t update all that frequently and where the data being stale (out of date) doesn’t really matter.</p>

<h3 id="http-long-polling">HTTP Long-Polling</h3>

<p>You won’t waste as many round trips with this transport as you do with standard polling. As the folks at Fanout say, <a href="http://blog.fanout.io/2013/03/04/long-polling-doesnt-totally-suck/">it doesn’t totally suck</a>. But during the reconnect cycle you <em>could</em> be seeing stale data during request-response cycle where there’s no server-client connection. And If updates come in frequently then there could be a lot of highly inefficient request-response cycles.</p>

<p>Data can be sent to the server as part of the request but that means new client data will need to wait for the next poll interval. Additional server requests can be made which result in an additional open connection.</p>

<p>When the freshness of data is not essential and client to server communication is infrequent then Long-Polling is a suitable solution. It’s not ideal for things like financial trading where freshness of data is imperative or multiplayer games and collaborative experiences where messages representing important changes in data are being sent from client to server.</p>

<h3 id="http-streaming">HTTP Streaming</h3>

<p>HTTP Streaming is generally the best of the HTTP solutions and probably as efficient as WebSocket for pushing data from the server to the client.</p>

<p>However, it’s a uni-directional connection meaning that a second connection needs to be made to achieve bi-directional communication. When data needs to be sent to the server a second connection must be opened. And if lots of data is being sent to the server then data is queued until the previous client to server request has completed or further additional connections need to be established. This is a problem for realtime interactive applications that want to offer the best possible latency and performance.</p>

<p>A solid solution for apps where data needs to be instantly pushed from client to server, where the freshness of data is important. Data displays, dashboards, realtime maps etc. are good fits. HTTP Streaming  suffers the same problems as HTTP Long-Polling when it comes to client to server communication so use cases like multiplayer games and truly interactive collaborative experiences.</p>

<p>And this is where WebSocket wins out.</p>

<h3 id="websocket">WebSocket</h3>

<p>WebSocket perfectly suits increasingly interactive functionality and higher frequency bi-directional communication as you really start to see the benefits of low latency, efficiency and small payloads.</p>

<p>The bi-directional connectivity also starts to be highly important as we can use a single connection per client to do the majority of our message passing. And this is clearly much more efficient than multiple HTTP connections.</p>

<p>If your data doesn’t update all that frequently then maintaining your own infrastructure to support WebSocket is probably an overhead. However, as soon as the frequency of data increases and the experiences become interactive WebSocket shines. Data displays, highly active chat, fast moving activity streams, collaborative experiences, second screen experiences that need to stay in sync, collaborative apps and multiplayer games all massively benefit from what WebSocket has to offer.</p>

<h4 id="note-its-not-just-user-driven-interactions">Note: It’s not just user-driven interactions</h4>

<p>WebSocket is essential where bi-directional communication is required. The initial thought is obviously that this is user driven interaction - and until now I’ve done nothing to say otherwise. However, that’s not always the case. It could be that your solution requires a relative interactive protocol e.g. for updating data subscriptions. Again, WebSocket is the best solution for this.</p>

<h3 id="http-polling-v-http-long-polling-v-http-streaming-v-websocket">HTTP Polling v HTTP Long-Polling v HTTP Streaming v WebSocket</h3>

<p>To summarise, here’s a comparison of where I see each of the realtime connection transports fitting.</p>

<table class="default"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Transport</th>

<th>Message Latency</th>

<h2 id="websocket-everywhere">WebSocket Everywhere!</h2>

<p>My - hopefully informed - opinion is that WebSocket is by far the best realtime connection transport. If it weren’t for problems with legacy browsers, firewalls and proxies WebSocket would be the <em>only</em> realtime transport that we would need for use case where realtime really matters. We’re not all that far from making that possible. Based on the stats that Pusher has this means 90% of connections use WebSocket and the rest use either Flash WebSocket emulation or HTTP.</p>

<p>I’m always open to opinion and feedback on all of this. I’m more than willing to change my opinion based on solid arguments - believe it or not it took time for me to be convinced about the benefits of WebSocket. So, if you’ve any questions then please don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The callback has been invoked, the Promise<sup><small>☀</small></sup> fulfilled. I’m <em>super-excited</em> to be rejoining <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> to head up evangelism and developer experience.</p>

<p>This leaves a BladeRunnerJS Developer Evangelist role vacant so please <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">get in touch</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<p><small><sup>☀</sup> This is a play on words. Rejoining wasn’t planned.</small></p>

<h2 id="rejoining-pusher">Rejoining Pusher</h2>

<p>When I <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/07/04/leaving-pusher-what-next.html">left Pusher back in June 2013</a> I said it was the best job I’d ever had. I’ve enjoyed my time back at Caplin, but I’d still say that the most enjoyment and best sense of achievement I’ve ever experienced was during my first stint at Pusher. So I’m extremely excited to be rejoining.</p>

<p><a href="http://pusher.com"><img align="center" src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/images/pusher.png" alt="Pusher logo" style="width: 250px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>Some would say <em>you should never go back</em>. <strong>I disagree</strong>. My frequent returns to Caplin have proven there are benefits and both myself and Caplin have benefitted from this in the past. Time away can make you aware of what worked and what didn’t. You can make sure that you do the things that worked and find alternative solutions for those that didn’t. When you step away you see opportunities and benefits that you couldn’t see from the inside. I’m very pleased that my contribution to Pusher at the very beginning has legacy, I’ve maintained a good relationship with everyone there and that <a href="https://twitter.com/maxthelion">Max</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/copypastaa">Sylvain</a> and the rest of the team will have me back! If you’re interested in joining me at Pusher, <a href="http://pusher.com/jobs#job-positions">we are hiring</a>.</p>

<h3 id="evangelismadvocacyrelations">Evangelism/Advocacy/Relations</h3>

<p>My new job title will be “Head of Developer Evangelism”. I guess that’ll look good on LinkedIn. What I hope it reflects is that having “evangelised” for over four years that I have a good understanding of developer relations/advocacy/evangelism, why the role is required, and what needs to be done in order to fulfill the business needs in this department. I chose to go with the term “Evangelism” in my job title rather than the other options as I feel it better reflects my attitude about realtime web technologies. I still feel there is <em>preaching</em> to be done to convince others about how awesome realtime is! And, as before, this won’t just be about Pusher, it’ll be about realtime in general. Of course I will also <em>advocate</em> for, and build <em>relations</em> with, developers who use Pusher.</p>

<p>I’m going to again focus on talking about and demonstrating how beneficial - and cool to develop with - realtime web technologies are. Pusher are a leading name in the realtime web technology industry so it’s fantastic to be able to represent such a company when giving talks and when writing articles. There are still many developers and business decisions makers who aren’t aware of realtime web tech so I really want to reach out to them and convince them of the benefits and uses cases.</p>

<p>So, if you’d like me to write an article for your site or speak at an event on realtime web technologies <a href="mailto:phil@pusher.com">please get in touch (phil@pusher.com)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h3>

<p>As well as my love for realtime web technologies, I’m still passionate about developer tooling. <strong>Pusher is a hosted developer tool</strong>: it’s purpose isn’t just to make it easy to add realtime functionality to web and mobile apps. It also makes complex things simpler in order to make the lives of developers easier. So I’m really pleased that I’m going to be involved in maintaining and enhancing the Pusher developer experience including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>the onboarding process</strong> - quickly showing what Pusher is capable of doing for you and in doing so making it easy to get started and reach a point of achievement as soon as possible</li>
  <li><strong>documentation</strong> - ensuring that the information required to get the most out of Pusher is clear and accessible</li>
  <li><strong>libraries</strong> - ensuring libraries offer common functionality on top of our raw WebSocket, HTTP fallback and REST APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>gathering feedback</strong> - by attending hackathons, working on support and feeding that back into the product</li>
  <li><strong>developer tools</strong> - the <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/debugging#pusher_debug_console">Pusher Debug Console</a> and <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/debugging#event_creator">Event Creator</a> are awesome. More stuff like this please!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll offically start back at Pusher from 15th of December. But I’m already set up with my re-activiated <a href="mailto:phil@pusher.com">phil@pusher.com</a> account and am raring to get started. So, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me now regarding events, articles or any questions at all you have about Pusher or realtime technology in general.</p>

<p>Did I mention I’m excited?!?!</p>

<h2 id="what-about-bladerunnerjs">What about BladeRunnerJS?</h2>

<p>In addition to writing about rejoining Pusher I wanted to share a bit about BladeRunnerJS.</p>

<p><a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org"><img align="center" src="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bladerunner-js.png" style="width: 250px; float: right; padding-left: 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>I joined <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin</a> (for the 4th time) to help them open source and evangelise BladeRunnerJS (BRJS). To help a company with the process of open sourcing, building a brand around an open source product, identifying the USPs and innovation of a product, giving talks and blogging about them has been a rewarding challenge.</p>

<p>One of the great things about Caplin is you get to work with a bunch of friendly and innovative people. So I’d like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/andyberry88">Andy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thecapdan">Dan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dchambers">Dominic</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ioanalianabalas">Ioana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jshawturner">James</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sospirited">Pre</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fauna5">Rich</a> and everybody else I’ve worked with over the past year and a half.</p>

<p>One of the things I’ve particularly enjoyed about this time is that it’s allowed me to take on a product owner role as well as one of evangelist. Providing input into a product is one of the things I really enjoy about the evangelist role. The level of impact you have on a product as an evangelist really depends on the company. But I feel I’ve positively influenced the present and future BRJS.</p>

<p>A big challenge when open sourcing and evangelising BRJS is that it’s not a simple product. It does a lot of things “out of the box” that could be achieved gluing a number of other tools together. The belief is that Caplin’s customers want to be productive from day one - the first line of code you write should be feature code - and BRJS does make that possible. But what this means is that in order to evangelise BRJS you need to convince others about a large number of concepts and ideas. Don’t get me wrong, you can still evangelise smaller topics like the <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org/blog/large-scale-complex-javascript-apps/">general issues</a> that you’ll come across when building <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y2xKMJtRCk">large complex front-end web apps</a>, about <a href="http://vimeo.com/70637558">testing strategies with large JS apps</a> and about <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2014/08/06/state-componentised-web.html">componentised web apps</a>.</p>

<p>But, in order to appreciate BRJS you really need to <em>think at scale</em>. You need to understand that your application will be large; will have a very big codebase, will have a codebase that’s around for a long time, will be contributed to by multiple developers working across multiple teams and needs to have an architecture that supports complex component interactions and technological change. As I said, it’s a challenging task.</p>

<p>It became clear that the <em>sweet spot</em> for BladeRunnerJS is Enterprise scale organisations. The sweet spot for me isn’t just Enterprise; I do like to go to Enterprise-focused events, run workshops and hold lunch ‘n learn sessions, but I also like going to local meetups, going to hack days and thinking in the small. For BRJS to have the best chance of adoption it really needs to focus on Enterprise and those that think about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small">programming in the large</a>.</p>

<p>That alone isn’t the only reason I’m moving on. For me the draw of Pusher - and again focusing on Realtime Web Technologies - was just too strong.</p>

<p>If BladeRunnerJS sounds like the sort of challenge you’d like to take on, then Caplin may have a role for you. Please <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">drop me an email</a> if this interests you.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s interesting how I used to always talk about the <strong>Real-time Web</strong> and <strong>Real-time Web Apps</strong> but now it really does need to be <strong>Real-time Internet Apps</strong> because <strong>IoT (The Internet of Things)</strong> now means we need to think beyond what we would traditionally class as Internet technologies. In this latest talk I cover realtime web technology communication paradigms and use cases for 2014 and beyond.</p>

<p>I also talk through the technology stack we have to build upon when trying to be innovative and that the new technologies we have now give us the opportunity to innovate sooner than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The idea of building applications out of a number of independent components isn’t anything new. But with Web Components on the horizon I thought it would be a good time to look at component-based application development, how we benefit from taking this approach, how we can build our applications in this way using existing technologies and how we’re likely to be building our front-end web apps in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-components?"><a href="#what-are-components?">What are Components?</a></h2>
<p>Software development is a field that suffers from a considerable amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_overload">semantic overload</a> (terms that can have more than one meaning). “Component” is clearly very generic so it makes sense to qualify what we mean when we talk about them in the context of front-end web apps.</p>
<p>A component within a front-end web app is a piece of software that has generally been designed and built to work within a larger application. A component can be represented within an application in a number of ways. It may have a UI (User Interface) or may be purely logical and could be throught of as more of a “service”.</p>
<p>UI components are easier to comprehend because there is a visual representation. Buttons, input boxes and textareas are nice simple examples. The hamburger menu button (whether you like it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/before-the-hamburger-button-kills-you/">or not</a>), tabs, calendars, a tab menu or even a rich text WYSIWIG editor can be considered to be more advanced examples.</p>
<p>Components that offer service-type functionality can be more difficult to get your head around. Examples may include cross-browser AJAX functionality, logging or one that offers some form of data persistence.</p>
<p>An important part of compontent-based development is that components can be composed out of other components. The rich text editor is a great example of this since it will be composed out of buttons, drop downs, some sort of rich view and so on. Another good example is the HTML5 video element which again contains buttons and also an element which renders content from a video data stream.</p>
<h2 id="why-build-components?"><a href="#why-build-components?">Why Build Components?</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have a good idea of what exactly we mean by component we should take a look at the benefits of building front-end apps in a component-based way.</p>
<h3 id="modular"><a href="#modular">Modular</a></h3>
<p>You may come across helpful phrases like <em>Components are inherently modular</em>. Well, thanks for that!</p>
<p>There’s that overloading of terms again. You could argue that the term “Component” better fits the idea of the UI and “Module” may be suited to logical functionality, such as that provided by a service. For me, modules and components are near-synonyms; the offer a way of grouping, focusing and encapsulating everything that is related to a unit of functionality.</p>
<h3 id="high-cohesion"><a href="#high-cohesion">High Cohesion</a></h3>
<p><em>Another ticked checkbox in the software engineering buzzword (term) bingo!</em> We are grouping and encapsulating everything related to a piece of functionality. In the case of components this can be the functional logic and assets; JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Images etc. This is precisely what we mean be cohesion.</p>
<p>Doing this makes maintaining a component much easier and in doing so increases reliablity. It also keeps the component focused, increasing the likelihood that it will be reusable.</p>
<h3 id="reusable"><a href="#reusable">Reusable</a></h3>
<p>When you see example components – particularly Web Component examples – the focus will be very much on reuse. Having a focused module with a clean and easy to understand API naturally encourages reuse. By building reusable components we adhere to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)</a> principle and all the benefits it provides.</p>
<p><strong>A word of warning:</strong> Don’t focus too much on trying to build reusable components. Focus on building the required piece of functionality for your application, which may be very specific. Then, if the need arises, or it becomes very clear that the component is reusable, put in the extra effort to make the component reusable. As developers love to create reusable functionality (libraries, components, modules, plugins etc.). Doing so prematurely can result in a world of pain. So, take all the other benefits of component-based development and accept that not everything you write can be 100% reusable.</p>
<h3 id="interchangable"><a href="#interchangable">Interchangable</a></h3>
<p>A nice and focused component API presents the opportunity to be able to easily change the underlying implementation. Or, if the components within the application are loosely coupled you can actually completely swap one component for another as long as they offer the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">API/interface/contract</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to use a service component that offered <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide">realtime functionality</a> via GoInstant, the news this week that they’re <a href="https://goinstant.com/blog/time-to-say-farewell">closing down</a> would probably be a bit of shock. However, you could quite feasibly create and use a <code>FirebaseComponent</code> or <code>PubNubComponent</code> as long as they offer the same data synchronisation-focused API.</p>
<h3 id="composable"><a href="#composable">Composable</a></h3>
<p>As previously discussed, a component-based architecture makes it easy for one component to be composed of a number of other components. This allows the component to stay focused and benefit from reusing functionality already build and exposed in other components.</p>
<p>More complex functionality can be built in this way; from richer application features to full applications. It’s one of the main benefits of this approach.</p>
<p>Whether absolutely everything should be a component is really up to you. There’s no reason why your application can’t be a <code>my-app</code> component which is then composed of <code>my-awesome-feature</code> and <code>my-fabulous-features</code>. And those components are then in turn composed of other components. If you see benefits from this approach then by all means stick with it. However, be careful not to over complicate things in the same way that you shouldn’t focus too hard on making a component reusable. Focus on delivering application functionality.</p>
<h2 id="building-components-now"><a href="#building-components-now">Building Components Now</a></h2>
<p>At <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a> we use a number of practices and principles when building our component-based applications. These are supported by the <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">BladeRunnerJS (BRJS)</a> open source toolkit. It’s called “BladeRunnerJS” because we encapsulate application features within something we call <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/concepts/blades">Blades</a>. Blades are application features that can be reused within the application, but aren’t reusable across applications. When a feature becomes truly generic we shift the definition into a library to be used across applications. Application-specific components (blades) and generic components within our apps can be defined using any library and framework we feel suits the feature we’re building best.</p>
<p>So, what libraries and frameworks exist that can help us build components?</p>
<p>Just take a look at the ever-popular <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC site</a> and you’ll see there are a vast number of front-end libraries and frameworks to choose from when making a decision on what technology to use when building your app. You could argue that any of these solutions can be used to build a component-based application. However, some of them come with in-built <code>Component</code> functionality. The most popular of these include AngularJS, Ember and React.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-components-communicate-with-each-other?"><a href="#how-do-components-communicate-with-each-other?">How do Components Communicate with Each Other?</a></h3>
<p>Before we dive into the examples it’s worth briefly mentioning inter-component communication. If these components are “independent” and “modular” how do they communicate with each other?</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to make components directly reference each other and interact via their API. The problem with this is that you introduce a direct dependency between components. In the short-term this can be fine. But over time your application may start to creak as you try to make changes; changing one component has an unexpected knock-on effect with another component. The decision to remove a component that isn’t delivering the product value you expected can result in your app breaking because one or more other components relied on it.</p>
<p>The solution here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loose coupling</a> where components have little or no knowledge of each other. They don’t directly create other components and when they need to communicate they do so through interfaces/contracts or via <strong>services</strong>. We’ve thought a lot about this when building BRJS apps and we use a <code>ServiceRegistry</code> to access <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/concepts/services/">services</a> that are used for inter-component communication or to interact with resources such as Web APIs. Solutions like Angular and Ember use services and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a> for this.</p>
<h3 id="my-avatar-example-component"><a href="#my-avatar-example-component">my-avatar Example Component</a></h3>
<p>To demonstrate the very basics of how each of theses libraries and frameworks allow us to build components we’ll build a simple example with a UI that fetches and displays a user’s avatar. The component, where possible, will have the tag <code>my-avatar</code> and will fetch an avatar based on two attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>service</code> which will allow a service to be set e.g. <code>twitter</code> or <code>facebook</code></li>
  <li><code>username</code> which identifies the user that we wish to fetch the avatar for</li>
  </ul>
<h3 id="angularjs"><a href="#angularjs">AngularJS</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> is probably the most popular front-end solution for building apps right now. The creators – Google – took the approach of thinking about how HTML would look if it were re-invented to address the needs of the web as they are now.</p>
<p>Components can be defined in Angular using <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive">custom directives</a>. Directives then allow you to declare custom components within your HTML markup.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://jsbin.com/lacog/2/embed?html,output" class="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170, 170, 170); width: 100%; min-height: 300px; height: 30px;"></iframe><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>This example demonstrate how simple it can be to use Angular directives. The <code>scope</code> values define the attributes that are used from the <code>my-avatar</code> element and those attributes are then used when building the underlying image tag that is rendered and shows the user’s avatar.</p>
<p>As you can see, the HTML looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;my-avatar service="twitter" username="leggetter" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ember"><a href="#ember">Ember</a></h3>
<p>There’s an ongoing debate about frameworks v libraries, where in some circles frameworks are seen as forcing you to work in particular ways and are therefore evil. Well, Angular is clearly a framework and Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale – the developers behind Ember – are also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jScLjUlLTLI">happy to call Ember a framework</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a> has in-built support for what it aptly calls <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/components/">Components</a>. The idea behind Ember Components is to align as much as possible with Web Components so that they can be migrated to native Web Components when browser support permits.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://jsbin.com/nawuwi/4/embed?html,output" class="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170, 170, 170); width: 100%; min-height: 300px; height: 30px;"></iframe><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>The example below uses <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a> for templating so the element definition doesn’t follow the exact same syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script type="text/x-handlebars"&gt;
  {{my-avatar service="twitter" username="leggetter"}}  
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="react"><a href="#react">React</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is the new kid on the block but has already gained a significant following. It’s developed by Facebook and is used for the full Instagram UI and some of the Facebook UI.</p>
<p>The recommended approach to building components using React is to define them using something called <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX</a>. This is a “JavaScript XML syntax transform recommended for use with React”. Don’t let this put you off. As they point out in the docs the idea is to allow HTML markup within a JavaScript structure to help you visualise.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell you can’t add markup directly to HTML and you have to create your component using JSX too. But, once you’ve defined a component you can then create other components that use it (composition).</p>
<p><iframe src="http://jsbin.com/qigoz/5/embed?html,output" class="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170, 170, 170); width: 100%; min-height: 300px; height: 30px;"></iframe><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>So, the syntax for declaring using the component requires an HTML element and a call to <code>React.RenderComponent</code> e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id="avatar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  React.renderComponent(
    &lt;MyAvatar service="twitter" username="leggetter" /&gt;,
    document.getElementById('avatar')
  );
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-future:-web-components-&amp;-beyond"><a href="#the-future:-web-components-&amp;-beyond">The Future: Web Components &amp; Beyond</a></h2>
<p>Web Components are the future! As the name suggests they promise to deliver native browser support for building components that can encapsulate functionality.</p>
<p>I’ll provide a brief overview of Web Components below and demonstrate how we can start using them now. For a deeper dive please see the <em>Resources</em> section at the end of this post.</p>
<p>The functionality they provide includes:</p>
<h4 id="custom-elements"><a href="#custom-elements">Custom Elements</a></h4>
<p>In the examples above that used Angular, Ember and React we focused on building the <code>my-avatar</code> component. Where possible this was represented as a custom element that we added to the page or template markup. Web Components includes native support for this via <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/">Custom Elements</a> – an absolutely fundamental part of the Web Component specification.</p>
<p>Part of defining new elements includes access to element lifecycle events such as when it is created (<code>createdCallback</code>), when it’s attached from the DOM (<code>attachedCallback</code>), when it detaches from the DOM (<code>detachedCallback</code>) and when element attributes change (<code>attributeChangedCallback(attrName, oldVal, newVal)</code>).</p>
<p>An important part of Custom Elements is the ability to extend the functionality offered by an existing element and in doing so inherit its functionality. In our examples below we’ll extend the <code>img</code> elemnet.</p>
<p>Ultimately what Custom Elements are doing, and what we tend to do when we write modular code, is abstracting away complexity to enable the users of the component to focus on getting value from using an element and build richer functionality.</p>
<h4 id="shadow-dom"><a href="#shadow-dom">Shadow DOM</a></h4>
<p>Remember IFRAMES? Many of us still use them because they ensure JavaScript and CSS from a widget or component don’t leak into a page. The <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/">Shadow DOM</a> provides this scope protection without the baggage that comes with IFRAMES. The official line on this is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Shadow DOM is designed to provide encapsulation by hiding DOM subtrees under shadow roots. It provides a method of establishing and maintaining functional boundaries between DOM trees and how these trees interact with each other within a document, thus enabling better functional encapsulation within the DOM.
</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="html-imports"><a href="#html-imports">HTML Imports</a></h4>
<p>We’ve been able to import JavaScript and CSS for a long time. <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/">HTML Imports</a> give us the ability to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents. The simplicity also means it’s easy for us to build components composed from other components.</p>
<p>Finally, the format is ideally suited for reusability and distribution through your favourited package management solution (e.g. <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/component/guide">Component</a>).</p>
<h4 id="templates"><a href="#templates">Templates</a></h4>
<p>Many of us already use solutions like handlebars (that we used in the Ember example, above), mustache or underscore.js templating. Web Components adds native support for <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/template/">Templates</a> via a <code>template</code> element.</p>
<p>Native templates allow you to declare fragments of markup which are parsed as HTML but classed as being “hidden DOM”. They go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later on at runtime. They are queryable and won’t load any related assets until they are inserted into active DOM.</p>
<h3 id="platform.js"><a href="#platform.js">Platform.js</a></h3>
<p>But – as per usual – we’re not quite in the position to be able to use them as browser support isn’t there yet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/web-components/web-component-status.png" alt="" scale="0" /><br />
<small><em>Web Component Browser support as of 27 Jun 2014</em></small></p>
<p>But – also as per usual – we can start using some of the functionality that Web Components offer through the magic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/web-components/web-component-polyfill.png" alt="" scale="0" /><br />
<small><em>Web Component Browser support thanks to Polyfills</em></small></p>
<p>The great news here is that the two most progressive browser vendors, Google and Mozilla, are working together on a polyfill to help us build Web Components now.</p>
<p>The example below uses <code>platform.js</code> and demonstrates how the <code>my-avatar</code> element can be defined as an extension of the <code>img</code> element. The fantastic thing about this is that it therefore picks up all the functionality of the native image element, such as accessability.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://jsbin.com/pihuz/4/embed?html,output" class="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170, 170, 170); width: 100%; min-height: 300px; height: 30px;"></iframe><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/">HTML5 Rocks Custom Elements tutorial</a> for much more information on create Custom Elements.</p>
<p><em>Note: If the platform.js interests you then also take a look at <a href="http://bosonic.github.io/">bosonic</a>.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of native technology support is to offer a base for us to build on top of. So Web Components don’t signal the end for libraries and frameworks.</p>
<h3 id="polymer"><a href="#polymer">Polymer</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> is the perfect example to demonstrate building on top of native Web Component functionality. It provides an opinionated simplified mechanism for creating custom Polymer elements and provides a number of <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html">core</a> and <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html">UI (Paper)</a> components for you to build your applications upon.</p>
<p><img src="/images/web-components/layers-of-polymer.png" alt="" scale="0" /></p>
<p>Below you can see how the simple <code>my-avatar</code> is easily achieved and we get to use our preferred markup too.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://jsbin.com/gukoku/2/embed?html,output" class="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170, 170, 170); width: 100%; min-height: 300px; height: 30px;"></iframe><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Google are really pushing Polymer. Check out the <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html">Polymer getting started guide</a> for a hands-on example.</p>
<h3 id="x-tag-&amp;-brick"><a href="#x-tag-&amp;-brick">X-Tag &amp; Brick</a></h3>
<p>Mozilla have developed their own Custom Element polyfill called <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/">X-Tag</a>. X-Tag is a library that polyfills several features that enable Web Components in the browser and it will soon provide full Web Component support.</p>
<p>Here’s the <code>my-avatar</code> Custom Component created using X-Tag – it’s very similar to the defined specification:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://jsbin.com/wexiz/2/embed?html,output" class="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170, 170, 170); width: 100%; min-height: 300px; height: 30px;"></iframe><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Mozilla have also created a library called <a href="http://mozbrick.github.io/">Brick</a> which includes X-Tag and provides “a collection of UI components designed for the easy and quick building of web application UIs” in a similar way to what Google are looking to offer with Polymer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of benefits to building applications with component-based architectures and you can tell from the approach that existing frameworks have taken and from Web Components that it’s recommended when building front-end web apps.</p>
<p>This whirlwind tour of the <strong>State of the Componentised Web</strong> has likely added to the weight of choice we developers already have when it comes to frameworks and tooling. But, Web Components may be the light at the end of the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>Web Components will provide a native and unified way of building applications</strong>. Existing frameworks will likely move to use Web Components or demonstrate how they can be used alongside them. Ember’s strategy is to make it easy to migrate to Web Components and Facebook’s React is a good example of where integration is most likely – there’s already a <a href="http://pixelscommander.com/polygon/reactive-elements/example/">ReactiveElements</a> that demonstrates this. Since Angular and Polymer are Google projects it’s also highly likely that these two projects will align.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nearly two months in, I thought I'd publish 10 realtime web technology predictions for 2014 based on how it developed in 2013 and the trends I've seen so far this year. I've added two additional <strong>bonus predictions</strong> for good measure.</p>

<p><em>Note: I came up with most of this list at the start of the year. I've only just got around to expanding upon the details now.</em></p>

<p>Before I go into the predictions: if you're interested in realtime technologies then you may be interested in the Realtime APIs panel that I'm putting together with <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Kin Lane</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy Conference 2014 in Amsterdam</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1.-realtime-all-the-apps"><a href="#1.-realtime-all-the-apps">1. Realtime All the Apps</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_18986-150x150.png" alt="icon_18986" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24284" /></p>

<p>We're seeing increased understanding of the benefits of realtime web tech so it's not surprising that the number of apps using the technology is rapidly increasing. Common functionality includes simple data updates for notifications, dashboards (sports, finance, site analytics and anything that's stat-heavy), realtime news and activity streams. Or more complex functionality for multi-user chat, collaborative applications (like Google Docs, Office Live and numerous online IDEs), multiplayer games, interactive 2nd screen experiences, realtime mapping and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and - hopefully - much, much more!</p>

<p>I'm making the obvious predication that in 2014 <strong>realtime will become a fundamental part of a significant number of new mainstream applications</strong>.</p>

<p><a name="commodity"></a></p>
<h2 id="2.-commoditization-of-realtime"><a href="#2.-commoditization-of-realtime">2. Commoditization of Realtime</a></h2>
<p>Since realtime is becoming so fundamental to application experiences, realtime functionality will make its way into many existing frameworks. This ultimately reduces the uniqueness of existing realtime solutions. This doesn't mean that dedicated realtime solutions aren't valuable, but it may mean that the use of some types of realtime (e.g. Pub/Sub) may diminish in the initial phases of projects.</p>

<p>Dedicated realtime services (hosted or otherwise) will be sought when scaling becomes necessary or tightly coupled architectures result in unwanted complexity. In this situation it's likely a move to loosely coupling architecture using a dedicated piece of realtime infrastructure is will be of benefit.</p>

<p>I'm actually really excited about this development as it means that existing solutions will need to <strong>"up their game"</strong> in order to present a compelling reason to use them at the start of a project. I'm hoping this will lead to lots of innovation when it comes to <strong>new features</strong> that meet common use cases and <strong>improved developer experiences</strong>. All the better for us developers!</p>

<p><a name="frameworks"></a></p>
<h2 id="3.-more-realtime-frameworks"><a href="#3.-more-realtime-frameworks">3. More Realtime Frameworks</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_8451-150x150.png" alt="icon_8451" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24288" /></p>

<p>With realtime becoming core to so much application functionality we're undoubtedly going to see an <strong>increase in the number of frameworks that are built on the foundation of realtime</strong>. By this I mean their fundamental functionality is powered by realtime technology; WebSocket, EventSource/Server-Sent Events, HTTP Streaming, WebHooks etc. and the use of Pub/Sub and data synchronisation is core.</p>

<p>Right now we have <a href="http://sailsjs.org/">SailsJS</a>, <a href="http://www.socketstream.org">SocketStream</a>, <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a> (a full platform) and <a href="http://derbyjs.com/">DerbyJS</a>, but I expect the number to grow significantly.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_27467-150x150.png" alt="icon_27467" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24298" /></p>

<p>Collaboration is probably the most powerful use case for realtime right now because it provides the most benefit; it enables and eases communication - absolutely key when working in any form of team - and it's an incredible time-saver.</p>

<p>Right now we're seeing lots of examples of chat, document editing, audio/video communication using WebRTC and proprietary technologies, and some drag n' drop experiences. But I'm very hopeful that we're going to see increasing innovation in the collaboration space.</p>

<p>Data synchronisation solutions appear to provide the best solution when it comes to collaboration because you are collaborating on the same data structure with others e.g. a data structure representing a document. So I'm going to carefully watch for updates to existing solutions and see if any new technologies or ideas surface.</p>

<p><a name="apis"></a></p>
<h2 id="5.-realtime-apis"><a href="#5.-realtime-apis">5. Realtime APIs</a></h2>
<p>I'm very hopeful that companies who are offering an API as a core part of their business are very aware of the developments of realtime technologies and use cases. As such they should know of the value of exposing and sharing data in realtime. Any event within a system has associated data and there's opportunity to share that and act upon it.</p>

<p>There is no reason why API providers can't start exposing evented data via a realtime API. Whether that's an API powered by WebHooks, HTTP Streaming or WebSockets, this data has the potential to add even <strong>more value to the offerings of API providers</strong>. Getting data sooner could even be seen as a premium service!</p>

<p>API infrastructure provides such as <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, <a href="https://apigee.com/about/">Apigee</a>, <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>: <strong>please take note!</strong></p>

<p><a name="webhooks"></a></p>
<h2 id="6.-even-more-webhooks"><a href="#6.-even-more-webhooks">6. Even more WebHooks</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_9094-150x150.png" alt="icon_9094" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24294" /></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">WebHooks</a> have been used for a very long time. But the term "WebHooks" used to define them is comparatively new. The great thing about having a commonly-used term is that it provides a way of communicating understood usage, encourages adoption, and leads to improved practices (and potentially standards).</p>

<p>We're seeing many more uses of WebHooks and it makes sense that the usage is going to increase further. This may be mainly because the web is still very HTTP-focused and the idea of publishing and receiving data via HTTP is understood and development can easily be undertaken.</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/01/30/webhooks-realtime-web/">What are WebHooks and how do they Enable the Realtime Web?</a>.</p>

<h2 id="7.-realtime-service-powered-apis"><a href="#7.-realtime-service-powered-apis">7. Realtime Service Powered APIs</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the "Commoditization of Realtime" prediction, hosted services offer a lot of value when it comes to scaling. Scaling realtime infrastructure is still relatively difficult so in order for API providers to facilitate point 5, "Realtime APIs", I believe it's highly likely that they will consider using existing Realtime Hosted API provides to do so.</p>

<p>Services like <a href="http://datasift.com">DataSift</a>, <a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a>, <a href="http://pubnub.com">PubNub</a>, <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> and <a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr</a> are in a great position. They already have the Realtime API infrastructure in place and in most cases they also have an authentication mechanism to enable a service to use them as their own infrastructure. The <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/blog/announcing-pam-serverless-access-control-for-your-app/">PubNub Access Manager</a> is a very good example.</p>

<p>There are a number of open source realtime solutions for transports like HTTP Streaming, HTTP Long-Polling and WebSocket, WebRTC (not fantastic, but growing) for scenarios like handling web browser connectivity and for common use cases like PubSub, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and PubSubHubbub.</p>

<p>But I'm yet to find an open source solution that offers the same kind of data synchronisation functionality as <a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a> or <a href="http://goinstant.com">GoInstant</a>. I'm hopeful that a solution we be along shortly.</p>

<p><em>If you know of one, or built one, please <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=Open Source Data Synchronisation">get in touch</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="9.-the-death-&amp;-revival-of-socket.io"><a href="#9.-the-death-&amp;-revival-of-socket.io">9. The Death &amp; Revival of Socket.IO</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> has had an amazing influence on the uptake of realtime web technologies. It offered accessible and powerful functionality that demonstrated the benefits of realtime web functionality. It was also part of the Node.JS revolution which really helped it's cause.</p>

<p>However, for a long time the project <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/graphs/contributors">wasn't maintained</a>. This has picked up recently and I'm hopeful that it means we're going to get an official 1.0 release soon. With so many companies and individuals using Socket.IO I'm surprised that somebody hasn't offered to sponsor development - or maybe they have, but it's just not public knowledge?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/graphs/contributors"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/socket-io-contributions-1024x279.png" alt="Socket.IO contributions graph" width="1024" height="279" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-24280" /></a></p>

<p>This tabloid-like headlined prediction is really to make the point that Socket.IO is a great solution that deserves some love. I can't see how this won't happen either through the original developers giving it more time (as they appear to be starting to do), through additional external contributions or through somebody else taking it on. It is <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT</a> after all.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a predicatable-predition, and something I've been talking about since at least 2011. In 2014 the usage of realtime web technology and IoT is going to skyrocket. IoT is already in near daily usage by hacking developers and during 2014 the usage is going to quickly increase in consumer technology.</p>

<p>Some solutions to watch out for include <a href="http://www.smartthings.com/">SmartThings</a>, <a href="ninjablocks">Ninja Blocks</a> and <a href="http://skynet.im/">SkyNet</a>.</p>

<p>A big deal has been made of WebRTC for audio and video communication. <em>And it is a very big deal</em> which will continue to result in lots of great apps using audio and video without the need to of costly infrastructure. But, the RTCDataChannel API has generally been overlooked, until recently. Dan Ristic gives a good <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/datachannels/">overview of RTCDataChannel</a> which I recommend checking out to get you thinking about how peer-to-peer data could be used within your realtime apps.</p>

<p>With this dramatic increase in development using realtime web technologies there's going to be an increased demand for tools that help the realtime app development process. We have some amazing tooling for request-response HTTP-based logging, debugging and playback. But when it comes to streaming or WebSocket solutions the tooling falls a little short. We instead rely on the libraries of solutions providing the necessary developer help.</p>

<p>I expect logging, debugging and tooling of existing solutions to improve and I also hope that we start to see dedicated tooling being created to help realtime web application development. Maybe <a href="http://runscope.com">RunScope</a> - who are pioneering developer tools as a service - will add WebSocket proxy support?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Realtime is going to be everywhere; from web and mobile apps to IoT consumer products. There are some interesting challenges to be undertaken when it comes to the UX of some of these apps and products, and to the Internet infrastructure which will be put under increasing load - an opportunity for solution providers to start thinking about adding features to help and cope with this.</p>

<p>The next 10 months of 2014 is going to be very exciting for realtime web technology, realtime solution providers, realtime hosted services, and more importantly for us developers. I expect some serious advancements in existing solutions and some new players to come along. Realtime web technology is going to become even easier to integrate into existing applications and we're going to have a much wider range of choice when building realtime apps from the ground up.</p>

<p>If you've seen any other trends, are building anything powering - or being powered by - realtime web technologies, or have predictions of your own please <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>On to part three...</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-0.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In this final part (<em>sorry for the delay</em>) I'm going to cover how you should approach choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://socket.io">Socket.IO</a> has done an amazing job when it comes to making people aware of realtime web technology. And it's a great solution.</p>
<p><strong>But, it shouldn't be the default choice when choosing your realtime web solution.</strong></p>
<p>You should instead take a number of factors into account. Then, if it provides the functionality required to meet your requirements, use it. But there are <strong>lots</strong> of other  fantastic realtime web solutions available that may be a better fit or your application's needs.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I would certainly recommend using an existing <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">realtime web tech solution</a>. Unless you have a very unique requirement there's no point going through the pain of building something from the ground up. If you really want to focus on adding realtime features to your apps then there is more than likely an existing solution that will enable you to start adding those features quickly.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Focusing on features: do you really want to have to write code to deal with connection fallback/upgrade strategy? Surely it's better to use a solution that has that in place.</p>
<p>If you use an existing solution you get support either from the company you've licensed the software from or/and from any community of developers that also use that product or service.</p>
<p>All software has to be maintained. Do you want to deal with the maintenance of the a realtime web solution as well as your application stack? If you use an existing solution that may be handled for you.</p>
<p>For example, when WebSocket came out <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> handled all the pain as the WebSocket specification changed during numerous revisions and they managed and supported a number of protocol versions. I know I would rather focus on adding features than dealing with the intricacies of the WebSocket spec.</p>
<p>Realtime web tech is still evolving. For example. WebSocket provides support for sub-protocols. If one of these becomes popular it may be the case that the solution you use has that support added in with no effort required from you or your team. If a clear additional use for realtime web technologies raises it's head - such as acting as the middleman in WebRTC connection handshaking - then it may be that the solution you use decide to add this in.</p>
<p>If your application is going to be popular you're going to have to consider how you scale your solution. Some solutions such as <a href="http://faye.jcoglan.com/architecture.html">Faye</a> and <a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/signalr-20/performance-and-scaling/scaleout-with-redis">SignalR</a> have put a lot of thought into this. Documentation and features will be available to help you achieve that.</p>
<p>When I posted <a href="/2013/10/31/fundamentals-realtime-web-realtime-web-functionality.html">part two</a> of this series to the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=2578818&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm&amp;goback=%2Egmr_2578818">LinkedIn Realtime Software &amp; Tech Group</a> the CTO of <a href="http://migratorydata.com/">Migratory Data Systems</a>, Mihai Rotaru, commented on my post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you agree that much more difficult to implement requirements, vital for any production deployment, should be considered when choosing a real-time web technology including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical scalability (and performance in general) </li>
<li>Horizontal scalability via fault-tolerant clustering </li>
<li>Guaranteed delivery of data in presence of failures (e.g. if the connection between a client and a messaging server is broken or if the messaging server serving the client goes down, the client will reconnect to another cluster member and will receive all messages published during the reconnection time) </li>
<li>Security of data including data entitlement</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Well put! Do you want to have to deal with all this? If not, use an existing solution (<em>and definitely consider using a hosted service</em>).</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I did say there were lots of solutions - and the above images doesn't show them all!</p>
<p>So, how do you go about filtering that list of existing solutions down and choosing the right one for your app?</p>
<p>Here are some additional considerations that will help.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to dive into the code of the solution you've chosen. So it makes sense to choose one that is written in a language that you and your team are comfortable with. In some cases you can then even contribute to the solution with bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The one language that there seems to be some limit with right now is PHP. For more information see my post on <a href="/2013/10/18/the-current-state-of-realtime-web-tech-for-php.html">The current state of Realtime Web Tech for PHP</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As with most web technology the initial focus was desktop web clients - web browsers. Mobile is also very big in this space but only some solutions have good native mobile client support (Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android and .NET for Windows Phone).</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When building for mobile you also need to think about things such as the amount of data you're sending, how frequently data is being sent and the processing these things result in on the mobile client.</p>
<p>I think PubSub solutions make you think about messaging and Data Sync solutions that only send deltas (the changes to data) are the best solutions in this space. I feel that RMI may abstract things away too much and you might forget you're making calls 'over the wire'.</p>
<p>The solution is also going to have to provide SSL support as many mobile networks tamper with or drop persistent connections; HTTP Streaming and WebSockets. You may also need HTTP fallback on mobile.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-9.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I don't have a comprehensive list of solutions that have good mobile support, but I do know that self hosted solutions like Socket.IO, Faye and SignalR do have some mobile client libraries and hosted services like Firebase, PubNub and Pusher do too. I'll try to update the <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">realtime web tech guide</a> to highlight this information.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-10.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In order to make a decision on the right realtime web solution for your application you need a good understanding of the functionality that it offers.</p>
<p>You need to understand the structure of the data, how it's used in the application and how you expect it to be requested and transmitted between the client and the server. How complex is the data and how much data will your app have?</p>
<p>How complex are the interactions between your user and the application and how does that affect the interactions between client and server?</p>
<p>All this should feed into you being able to choose the type of functionality you need.</p>
<p>Is it a simple messaging solution where you just get a data blob in an <code>onMessage</code> callback?</p>
<p>Do you have data that you want to be able to partition and have users selectively subscribe (PubSub) to sections of data?</p>
<p>Are the interactions more like method invocations?</p>
<p>Or are you synchronising data structures between clients?</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-11.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the diagram above there's an X-Axis representing functional complexity and the Y-Axis represents data complexity.</p>
<p>If the data in your system is simple and the application functionality (around that data) is also relatively simple then it's possible that a simple messaging solution (<code>onMessage</code>) may fit the application's needs.</p>
<p>As the complexity of the data increases (and the amount of data) then a PubSub solution is more likely to be a better fit.</p>
<p>If the data is simple and the the data sizes of the objects representing the method parameters are small, but the interactions are complex, then a RMI solution may suit your needs.</p>
<p>As data complexity increases along with application complexity then a Data Synchronisation solution may be a better fit.</p>
<p>This isn't a one-size-fits-all diagram, but it provides a nice simple way of considering which solution may suit your application's needs.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-12.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The diagram above shows how the examples I provided in the Benefits &amp; Use Cases section of <a href="/2013/10/28/history-background-benefits-use-cases-realtime.html">part one</a> fit into the functionality quadrants.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-13.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This diagram is an attempt to show the functionality offered by some of the available realtime web solutions. This may not be 100% correct but I plan to add this to the <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">realtime web guide</a> in order to make it as easy as possible for others to make contributes and fixes.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-14.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The stage in development that you are at can also affect what the most viable realtime web solution is for you.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-15.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you already have an application then you'll want to choose a solution that can easily be integrated with your existing application, and it's architecture.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-16.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It may be possible to integrate a self-hosted solution in a tightly coupled way. By that I mean the applicaiton web server handles both the HTTP requests and the persistent connections (e.g. WebSocket and HTTP fallback connections) and the logic for your web apps is integrated with your realtime web functionality.</p>
<p>It's possible that there would be less initial overhead in doing this (but not guaranteed if you're really shoe-horning the functionality in). However, as the project grows the complexity of your codebase will increase and you're highly likely going to start to experience problems caused by this complexity. Realtime vs standard web functionality is a good place to exercise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> and keep that functionality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely coupled</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-17.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It's generally agreed that a loosely coupled architecture is going to be easier to change, maintain, test and scale. Your DB may even be message-queue-capable (e.g. Redis) so a loosely coupled integration may actually be very simple.</p>
<p>In this situation you can also scale-out your realtime server independently of your web server.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-18.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hosted services offer the fastest and probably simplest integration option - it's one of their focuses, after all.</p>
<p>With a hosted service you get natural loose coupling and you can integrate via simple calls to their APIs. Or by pushing messages onto a queue where integration with the service is performed via one or more dedicated processes.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-19.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are an increasing number of realtime hosted services available. Those leading the way are <a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a>, <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> and <a href="http://pubnub.com">PubNub</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-20.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you don't presently have an application and are just kicking off your application development you have the full playing field of realtime web solutions to choose from. That includes all the solutions I've already discussed but also some new breeds of framework.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-6-21.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>These solutions come with realtime functionality baked-in as a core feature. The framework getting the most publicity right now - and the one with a large amount of funding - is <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a> (not to be confused with the original Meteor Perl solution). Meteor offers a full stack framework built on Node.js that lets you write all your functionality in JavaScript, share code between the front-end and backend, offers data synchronisation, RMI style functionality and also has built in JavaScript templating. They also offer application hosting.</p>
<p>Other solutions worth looking into are <a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a> (that also integrations well as a traditional hosted-service), <a href="http://sailsjs.org/">SailsJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream">SocketStream</a> and a number of solutions listed as a <a href="http://nobackend.org">no-backend solution</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-7-0.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In this three-part series, based on my "Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack" FOWA talk, I've covered a lot of information:</p>
<p>I've discussed why realtime functionality offers both business benefit in the form of increased capability and perception, and the user benefits through an improved service, faster access to information and richer functionality.</p>
<p>I've then gone into the type of functionality that realtime web solutions offer; simple messaging, PubSub, RMI and data synchronisation.</p>
<p>Finally, in this post I've covered how to go about choosing the right solution for you. Choose a good existing solution and consider choosing based on the language it was implemented in. Consider native mobile support as a requirement, and understand how your application will function so you can choose a solution offering the right kind of functionality. And I've covered how the stage of development that you are at should also be considered as there are some exciting new options available to choose from.</p>
<p>After over 10 years working with realtime web technologies I'm still very excited by realtime web technologies - I hope it shows. Realtime functionality is becoming more important and beneficial; the arrival of a number of realtime-focused frameworks demonstrates that. Other existing frameworks are adding this functionality and <strong>maybe it won't be long until realtime will be a standard part of most application frameworks and applications</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/slide-7-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I'm Phil Leggetter, I maintain the <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">realtime web tech guide</a>, I've written a book on building <a href="http://j.mp/realtime-web-apps-uk">Realtime Web Apps with a PHP stack</a> (because it's not as easy as it should be) and I'm presently working on open sourcing a developer toolkit for building complex front-end web apps called <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">BladeRunnerJS</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In part 1 of this 3-part write-up from my talk at FOWA London 2013 I covered the <a href="/2013/10/28/history-background-benefits-use-cases-realtime.html">History, Background, Benefits &amp; Use Cases of Realtime</a>. In this 2nd part I'm going to provide details on some fundaments about realtime web technology and an overview of the basic types of functionality that they offer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 1: <a href="/2013/10/28/history-background-benefits-use-cases-realtime.html">History, Background, Benefits &amp; Use Cases of Realtime</a></li>
  <li>Part 3: <a href="/2013/12/09/choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html">Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack</a></li>
  <li>The FOWA 2013 <a href="/2014/01/19/video-choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html">Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack video</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-fundamentals.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>What are the core concepts used in realtime web technologies? What are the fundamental raw technologies?  And, is it possible to break the types of functionality up into categories?</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-connect.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This one's pretty obvious! You need to connect to the source of data in order to receive new information from it. Without that connection there's no way of the new data being pushed to the intended recipients.</p>
<p>Ideally this will be a long-held persistent connection.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/still-polling-oh-dear.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, <strong>STOP POLLING</strong>.</p>
<p>If you check <em>very infrequently</em> for new data via a polling strategy that may still be okay. But in general, if you're polling at short intervals you are very likely to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be using resources unnecessarily</li>
<li>Have code complexity that isn't required</li>
</ul>
<p>Realtime web solutions are now very solid and efficient so you really should be using them. In fact, if you use a realtime web server instead of polling a standard web server you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use less client and server resources</li>
<li>Reduce the complexity of your code</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the server code that is executed when new data is available and updates the database:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
$update = $_POST['update'];
$data = json_decode($update, true);

$query = sprintf("INSERT INTO updates (key, value) VALUES ('%s', '%s')",
    mysql_real_escape_string($data['key'], $data['value']));

$result = mysql_query($query);

if($result) {
  header("HTTP/1.1 201 Created")
}
else { header("HTTP/1.1 418 I'm a teapot"); }
</code></pre>

<p>Here's some JavaScript that polls the server every 5 seconds to see if any new data is available:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">var lastUpdate = new Date();
setInterval(function() {
 $.getJSON('ajax/get_update.php?since=' + lastUpdate, function(data) {
   var items = [];

   $.each(data, function(key, val) {
     items.push('&amp;lt;li id="' + key + '"&amp;gt;' + val + '&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;');
   });

   $('#my_list').prepend(items);
 });
 lastUpdate = new Date();
}, 5*1000);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the server code that handles that polling request:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php // get_update.php
$since = $_GET['since']; // assume format is correct

$query = sprintf("SELECT updates WHERE created &gt; '%s'",
    mysql_real_escape_string($since));

$result = mysql_query($query); // assume no errors

$rows = array();
while($r = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
  $rows[] = $r;
}
return json_encode($rows);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's look at a usage scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site average of 10,000 users online at any one time</li>
<li>Over 1 Hour, with a 5 second polling interval</li>
<li>Pages load + resources estimate (HTML, CSS, JS, Images) = 50,000</li>
<li>Poll requests per minute = (60 / 5) = 12</li>
<li>Poll requests per hour = (12 * 60) = 720</li>
<li>Poll requests site-wide per hour = (360 * 10,000) = 7,200,000.</li>
<li><strong>Total: 7.2 Million requests</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Get scaling!</p>
<p>By using a realtime web technology you have dedicated and specialised resource to maintain those 10,000 persistent connections.</p>
<p>And the code would look something like this:</p>
<p>The JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>var connection = new Connection( 'realtime.example.com' );
var channel = connection.subscribe( 'my-channel' );
channel.bind( 'my-event', function( data ) {
  var items = [];
  $.each( data, function( key, val ) {
    items.push( '&lt;li id="' + key + '"&gt;' + val + '&lt;/li&gt;' );
  } );

  $( '#my_list' ).prepend( items );
});
</code></pre>
<p>On the server we can completely remove the code that handles the polling request. All we need to do is update the code after we've updated the database. This additional code publishes the new data to all interested recipients:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
require('Realtime.php');

$update = $_POST['update'];
$data = json_decode($update, true);

$query = sprintf("INSERT INTO updates (key, value) VALUES ('%s', '%s')",
    mysql_real_escape_string($data['key'], $data['value']));

$result = mysql_query($query);

if($result) {
  $realtime = new Realtime();
  $realtime-&gt;trigger('my-channel', 'my-event', $data);

  header("HTTP/1.1 201 Created")
}
else { header("HTTP/1.1 418 I'm a teapot"); }
</code></pre>
<p><small>Note: this code hasn't been checked - there may be a few errors. It's here to demonstrate a point</small></p>
<p>Here the call to trigger may push the data onto a message queue to be processed by the dedicated realtime infrastructure, or it may be to make a call to a hosted service to handle the distribution of that data.</p>
<p>There is much less code in the realtime scenario and it's also less complex.</p>
<p>In this scenario we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site average of 10,000 users online at any one time</li>
<li>Over 1 Hour, <strong>no polling</strong></li>
<li>Pages load + resources estimate (HTML, CSS, JS, Images) = 50,000</li>
<li><strong>That's it! Our standard web servers handle 50,000 requests</strong></li>
<li>During the hour our realtime infrastructure maintains 10,000 persistent connections</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/comet-hacks.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Many developers have understood the benefits of the timely delivery of data, the business value, the resource savings and the reduced complexity that realtime could offer (reduced complexity is a relatively recent thing).</p>
<p>But in order to achieve a persistent connection we had to use technology in ways it hadn't been intended to be used. Not only that, but the solutions were different depending on the web browser. <strong>We hacked the solutions</strong>.</p>
<p>Terms you may have heard before include <strong>HTTP Streaming</strong> and <strong>HTTP Long-Polling</strong>. Traditionally these have been hacks. And, just like the UK Comet Superstore, we want those hacky solutions to go away.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/w3c-realtime-standards-ftw.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And thanks to standardisation, they eventually will.</p>
<p>The fact that so many developers were trying to achieve "realtime push" meant that the standards body had to take note. After a number of years, and contribution from many of those developers who contributed to the hacked solutions, we now finally have two solutions that let us natively support realtime communication in our web browsers.</p>
<p><strong>But, it's not just web browsers!</strong> Because these are defined standards it means that they can be implemented in any technology. From web browsers, native mobile runtimes to constituents of the Internet of Things (search "Arduinos" for some great examples).</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sse-websockets.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The two solutions we now have are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-Sent Events</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource">EventSource API</a> - this is an HTTP-based solution, but taking a standardised approach and avoiding the "hacks".</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> - The WebSocket protocol and API is probably the most exciting standard. It allows for a persistent, bi-directional, full-duplex connection to be established between a client and a server.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are building truly interactive applications you are going to need bi-directional communication. And - as we'll see - even if you're building apps focusing on live content only you'll probably need a level of functionality that will still require bi-directional communication.</p>
<p>Hence, <strong>WebSockets are the best realtime client-server communication transport available</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Do not let anybody tell you otherwise!</strong></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/still-need-realtime-hacks.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately we do still need the hacks for scenarios such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where older browsers don't support these new standards</li>
<li>When tricky networks get in the way. These normally tend to be locked down corportate or educational networks, and some mobile network operators</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the realtime technology you choose needs to handle these "fallback" scenarios for you.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-functionality.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We now understand that we need to connect. But what about receiving data, and what sort of functionality should a realtime solution provide? How should the client and server interact with each other in order for you to add realtime functionality to your application?</p>
<p>I've broken this down into four types of functionality. This isn't perfect, but it's a good starting point.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-data-streams.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you are pushing relatively simple pieces of data from the server to your client then a simple <code>onMessage</code> type of functionality may well be good enough.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'd like a better name for this but I've gone with <code>onMessage</code> as it reflects the basic level of functionality offered by the <code>EventSource</code> API and is also on the <code>WebSocket</code> API.</em></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/onmessage-code-example.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the example above we use a <a href="https://github.com/sockjs">SockJS</a> realtime solution. We connect to our realtime server, assign a function handler to the <code>onmessage</code> property, and that's it.</p>
<p>On the server we do some setup, but in order to push data to the client we simply use the <code>write</code> function on the connection object to push the data.</p>
<p>This is the most basic level of functionality. Here SockJS is a great solution as it focuses on basic messaging and connectivity. If you want to, you can layer on much more complex functionality.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pubsub.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern"><strong>Publish/Subscribe</strong> pattern</a> is something that the majority of developers understand. In realtime web technology it's the most common form of functionality offered and is very data-centric.</p>
<p>With a PubSub solution you normally subscribe to data using a <code>string</code> identifier. This is normally called a Channel, Topic or Subject.</p>
<p>As the data within your application becomes more complex and you wish to receive updates when subsets of data change, or you have naturally partitioned your data, <strong>PubSub</strong> works very well.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-subscriptions.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Although most of us understand PubSub I still like to provide a silly example to try and get us thinking about scenarios that we don't generally associate with subscriptions. In doing that it can get us in the mindset of considering more scenarios as data subscriptions. And in turn, get us thinking about exposing changes in data to users and systems, where we presently let that <strong>change event</strong> go unnoticed.</p>
<p>My silly example is:</p>
<p>If I do a search for "aliens" in Google I get a relatively fresh set of results returned and displayed to me. Once that data is returned it instantly becomes historical.</p>
<p>If we were then to experience an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/">Independence Day (movie) moment</a>, and the sky around our planet were suddenly filled with Alien spacecraft, this Google search would not be showing me the most relevant information <strong>right now</strong>.</p>
<p>Google should instead be pushing updates of reports of Alien sightings from news channels, pictures of Aliens that have been posted to social networks (because, of course we'd stop to snap that Alien with a ray-gun instead of running), and as the Alien's invade our digital space I'd want to see them in my search results!</p>
<p>Now, Google did have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Real-Time_Search">realtime search</a> solution in the past. I'm not sure quite why they dropped it. Maybe it was because they didn't want to renew their subscription to the Twitter Firehose? I think the lack of this feature is a mistake.</p>
<p>So, start thinking about scenarios in your applications that represent subscriptions. A user being on a URL, where they have an obvious interest in the data on that page, could easily be considered a subscription.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pusher-realtime-pubsub.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The example above uses <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>.</p>
<p>On the client I connection and then subscribe to an <code>alien-search</code> channel. This channel name is simply a name I've chosen to use within my application. On that channel object, that represents the subscription, I then bind to different types of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>new_result</code> - a new search result has become available</li>
<li><code>result_updated</code> - an existing result I already have has been updated</li>
<li><code>results_deleted</code> - an existing result has been deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps really nicely with C<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">R</span>UD operations. As with the channel name, the event names are entirely up to me.</p>
<p>When these events are received by the client the appropriate callback function is called and we can update our application accordingly.</p>
<p>On the server the functionality is really simple. When the event occurs (a new search result is available, one is updated etc.) we trigger the appropriate event on the channel.</p>
<p>Using a realtime PubSub solution should - and is - this simple.</p>
<p>Not all PubSub solutions will offer the event abstraction that Pusher do. I think it's really powerful and maps very nicely to the evented nature of realtime applications.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-data-sync.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The next type of functionality that is available is <strong>data synchronisation</strong>. In data sync solutions the focus is manuipulating data structures and ensuring that all applications get a synchronised version of that data structure.</p>
<p>An obvious example of this is Google Docs where the data, that represents the document that multiple users are editing, is synchronised between all users.</p>
<p>In these scenarios it's also worth being aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">operational transforms</a> - basically detecting and handling data edit collisions.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/firebase-realtime-sync.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a> offer a synchronisation solution. In the code above a structure is referenced and a piece of data added to the collection.</p>
<p>Event handlers are bound on the data reference so that any time new data (a child) is added, a child is changed, or removed, the application is informed. This is very powerful and <strong>very easy</strong> as I found out when I won the <a href="/2013/03/29/how-i-won-the-esri-devsummit-100-lines-of-javascript-competition.html">ESRI 100 Lines of JS challenge</a> - yeah, 5 lines of code to add realtime collaborative functionality!</p>
<p>You can see how this could be mapped to a PubSub solution, and maybe it's an abstraction on top of PubSub, but the point here is that it's all about working with a data structure which is a relatively complex abstraction and a specific style of functionality.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-rmi.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The final style of functionality is RMI - <strong>Remote Method Invocation</strong>. Some refer to this as the Object Oriented cousin of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a>. It is ultimately about interacting with objects, and calling methods on them, over a network.</p>
<p>This is amazingly powerful.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that a interacting with an object could result with a network call. PubSub makes that relatively clear, but the RMI abstraction can hide this away to the extent that you may forget you're making network calls.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/signalr-realtime-rmi.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The above examples using <a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr">SignalR</a> which is now part of ASP.NET. The SignalR framework does provide simple low-level messaging functionality, but the framework, and their docs, primarily focuses on RMI functionality using something they've called <a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/signalr-20/hubs-api/hubs-api-guide-server">Hubs</a>.</p>
<p>Hubs provide a way of defining objects on the server and the framework creates client-side JavaScript proxy objects to that exposes the server-side functionality.</p>
<p>In this example, a <code>ChatHub</code> extends a <code>Hub</code> object in order to offer the RMI functionality. On the client the chat hub proxy object can be reference via <code>$.connection.chatHub</code>.</p>
<p>The server defines a <code>Send</code> method which can be accessed on the client via <code>chat.server.send</code>.</p>
<p>On the server the SignalR framework exposes a way of calling a function on all connected clients via the <code>Clients.All</code> property. In this case it calls a <code>broadcastMessage</code> function.</p>
<p>The client defines a <code>chat.client.broadcastMessage</code> function which can, and is, invoked from the server.</p>
<p>As I said, this is very powerful!</p>

<p>By now you should have a good idea of why realtime rocks (is beneficial to users and for your business), have an understanding of some of the raw fundamentals (hacks, Server-Sent Events and WebSocket) and that the functionality can roughly be broken down to onMessage, PubSub, Data Synchronisation and RMI.</p>
<p>In part 3 I'll demonstrate how you can use all this information when <strong>Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack</strong> (wow, that title still isn't catchy!).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is part 1 of a 3 part series on <strong>Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack</strong>. It's based on the talk I recently gave at the Future of Web Apps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Part 2: <a href="/2013/10/31/fundamentals-realtime-web-realtime-web-functionality.html">Fundamentals of the Realtime Web &amp; Realtime Web Functionality</a></li>
<li>Part 3: <a href="/2013/12/09/choosing-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.html">Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For some time I've seen FOWA as one of the biggest web conferences around. So, when Future Insights approached me to talk at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2013/">FOWA 2013</a> I was very excited (and nervous). Now that the event has been and gone I'm pleased to say that both the event and my talk went well.</p>
<p>Since <a href="/2013/07/04/leaving-pusher-what-next.html">leaving Pusher</a> I've kept a keen eye on the realtime web tech scene. And since I'm now unaffiliated to one realtime company (although I have to admit I've still a soft spot for Pusher) I can now be even more open about other technologies and how they compare (I do like to think I was always very open and honest anyway).</p>
<p>Below you can find a summary of my FOWA 2013 talk. If you simply want to dive into the slides you can find them <a href="http://leggetter.github.io/talks/realtime-tech-stack/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/choosing-your-realtime-web-app-tech-stack.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A talk on <strong>Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack</strong> seemed an appropriate way to both demonstrate that and share some of the knowledge I've aquired since working in and around realtime web tech since 2001.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/web-communication.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In 1991 the first documented version of HTTP was released. HTTP is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request-response">request-response</a> protocol where a client initiates a connection and request for data, the server responds and the connection is closed.</p>
<p>To achieve realtime web communication a connection needs to be maintained so that if either side of that connection has new data it can instantly be sent to the other party.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1996 that it became possible to create a persistent client-server connection in a web browser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_&#40;programming&#41;#Early_Java_applets">with the help of a Java Applet</a>.</p>
<p>However, Java Applets never really become a popular - or viable choice - due to a <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-10-1997/jw-10-lawsuit.html">lawsuit</a>, generally flakey Sun JVM <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveConnect">LiveConnect</a> implementation and a general resistence for a requirement on browser plugins.</p>
<p>As ever, developer needs prevailed and around 2000 we managed to hack some purely native web-browser solutions using persistent HTTP connections.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/is-the-realtime-web-a-threat-to-google-search.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, realtime web technologies have been around since 2000 where it was primarily used by companies either in, or targeting, finance. But it wasn't until a number of years later that the use of the technology went mainstream.</p>
<p>In 2009 <a href="http://scobleizer.com/about/">Robert Scoble</a> wrote a blog post asking <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/02/09/is-the-real-time-web-a-threat-to-google-search/">"Is the real-time web a thread to Google search?"</a> At that time he was using a service called <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> and was very excited that as soon as he posted information on the network that it was <strong>instantly discoverable</strong> through search.</p>
<p>Back in 2009 we were all quite used to waiting days for our new online content to be discovereable. We would post a blog post, or create a new website and wait days for search engines like Google to find out content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s do a search for anyone who has written about the Canon 5D MK II but lets constrain that to posts that have at least one like and at least four comments. […] Note that the post I wrote just one minute ago is already in the results page. This is the real-time web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FriendFeed's functionality suggested that this no longer had to be the case; that the realtime web was going to change all that. Ok, this wasn't to the same scale as Google, but it was to a reasonable scale.</p>
<p>Back then, even <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">Wikipedia had no definition for "real-time web"</a>. The <a href="/2009/07/09/wikipedia-now-has-a-definition-for-real-time-web.html">first definition</a> was added in mid-2009 and was search-focused.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-web-wikipedia-definition.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now, however the definition is very much focused on the <strong>Instant Delivery of Data</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/instant-delivery-of-data.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This has been partly enabled by social networks' ability to know who is interested in data. We now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow people on Twitter</li>
<li>Friend people on Facebook</li>
<li>Add people to Circles on Google+</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these represent a data subscription to updates and posts. This means these social networks know what data we are interested in so as soon as it's available it can be delivered to us. This type of functionality is ideal for realtime web technology.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/its-not-really-realtime.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You shouldn't use this technology to control the safety system in your neuclear power station. Nor should you use it to control the breaks in your car. But it's perfectly capable of being used to send data in less than 300ms. I have benchmarks that show that you can get the average lower than 100ms. So, we're talking "soft realtime".</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/data-timely-manner-context.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>What is very important is that the time between the data being generated and it being delivered needs to be small enough for data to maintain its relevance.</p>
<p>If the data isn't delivered within a timely manner it has the potential of losing relevance and context. Realtime web technologies actually enable you to instantly deliver data and therefore maintain context. <strong>I think the fact that realtime technology can help you maintain context is going to be a big factor in the technology is going to be increasingly important</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/benefits-use-cases-realtime.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>What are the benefits that realtime enable and how is this technology being used right now? Here are a few areas where I believe realtime is important along with a few examples where the technology is being used and making a difference.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/push-equals-convenience.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The fact that you can push information to those that have registered interest is <em>convenient</em>.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a silly example, but: if you had to open a phone or SMS application and keep hitting a button to see if you can any incoming phone calls or SMS messages that really wouldn't be convenient.</p>
<p>The same therefore goes for data within applications; as new information becomes available or some other call to action is available (e.g. phone rings -&gt; pick up the phone) then the user should be made aware.</p>
<p>Realtime Web Tech makes this a possiblity in web and mobile applications.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/itv-news-realtime-notifications.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The first and simplest example of using Realtime technology is <a href="http://www.itv.com/news">ITV News</a>. Around a year ago they had a site redesign and moved towards an <strong>Activity Stream</strong> look and feel. Along with this they added realtime content delivery and notifications. The content isn't instantly displayed. Instead a notification is shown to say the new content is available; when the notification it slides in.</p>
<p>While this may not be the most innovative use of realtime technology it has worked. Around 6 months ago I was told that the site redesign, along with this realtime functionality, resulted in a 10-fold increase in site traffic.</p>
<p>ITV News has become a destination for <strong>realtime news</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/man-city-2nd-screen.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Manchester City released a <a href="http://www.aqueduct.co.uk/a-new-season-a-new-mcfc-match-day-centre/">Match Day Centre</a> application at the start of the season. It shows <strong>realtime stats</strong> about an in-play game. I used to love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Championship_Manager_series">Championship Manager</a> and Football Manager style games so I really get this. I even created a <a href="https://plus.google.com/115842503466861231289/posts/TofYhpk2WkD">demo for Opta Sports</a> when I was working on the <a href="/tag/kwwika">Kwwika</a> project that looked very similar to this.</p>
<p>I believe this is a great example of a <strong>2nd Screen Experience</strong> that offers lots of value. It really complements watching a live game - you just can't integrate all that data into the main screen. It's also really valuable standalone.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-google-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As most of us know, Google Analytics has a realtime option. But is this just a marketing gimmick? What real value does this offer?</p>
<p>When we publish new content it's great to see the reaction that the content is getting, what traffic it's resulting in and where that traffic is coming from. <em>And that's the real value and opportunity here</em>.</p>
<p>If you see a lot of traffic coming from a destination, or for a particular keyword, the <strong>opportunity</strong> that realtime gives you is to be able to <strong>react</strong> to that realtime information. You can tweak your content to get better conversions and to take advantage of the unexpected traffic.</p>
<p>If you see the traffic drop you can <strong>react</strong> by looking at your server stats to check CPU, memory and disk usage.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/speed-equals-opportunity.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The speed at which you can deliver information, and the speed at which you receive information, presents both the product or service provider (you) and the user with <strong>opportunity</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/foursquare-realtime-checkin-notification.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A simple example of the how realtime enables opportunity is one provided by FourSquare. If I check-in to a coffee shop and a friend happens to be near-by they will get a notification. We therefore have the opportunity of catching up over a coffee. If I've never actually met that friend in person before (that happens a lot nowadays) then we get the opportunity to finally meet up in person. Who knows what will come from that meetup?</p>
<p><strong>I love the serendipitous nature of this.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/caplin-trader-the-evolution-of-realtime.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Back in 2001 I joined <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a> as a university graduate. They were one of the pioneers of realtime web technology, focusing on providing realtime web technology to financial organisations.</p>
<p>The thing that makes their flagship front-end products - now <a href="http://www.caplin.com/caplin-trader">Caplin Trader</a> - interesting is how they have evolved. Initially the focus was on enabling realtime in-browser data displays to financial organisations where realtime data really makes a difference; milliseconds can make a difference between lots of money made or lost. Now the focus is firmly on enabling realtime interactions with trading systems and traders - actually executing trades and realtime communication within a web trading front-end.</p>
<p>This demonstrates - for me - the most exciting use of the technology right now. <strong>Enabling realtime communication and interaction</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/interaction-equals-engagement.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and many other platforms are successful because they are <strong>communication platforms</strong>. When we publish a tweet or a status update we don't do that in the hope that we're ignored. We do so in the hope that our update will be retweeted, favourited, replied-to or liked; that it will start some for of interactive communication experience.</p>
<p>When we interact in an application we engage with it, we spend a lot more time using it. From an application creators point of view this is massively important.</p>
<p><strong>Realtime Web Technologies enable us to create interactive and engaging functionality within our applications</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jabbr-realtime-chat.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to trying out realtime web tech you'll probably start by building a chat application. <a href="http://about.jabbr.net/">Jabbr</a> is one example.</p>
<p>We probably all use chat applications on a daily basis. So, we understand their value. Realtime web technologies make building chat functionalty really easy so we can integrate similar functionality into any application and start to get the benefit directly in our apps.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/google-docs-realtime-collaboration.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> is probably the area of communication where I'm most excited to see this technology used. We have some great examples of uses now, but I think we're going to see a lot of innovation in this space.</p>
<p>Most of use have used Google Docs before. It's a great product and saves us a tonne of time. How did we used to collaborate on docs previously?</p>
<ol>
<li>Write initial document draft</li>
<li>Add to Share Point (oh dear!) or email it as an attachment to single collaborator</li>
<li>Collaborator turns on Track Changes and edits doc</li>
<li>Wait for review to be checked back in to Share Point or emailed</li>
<li>Make updates based on review and back to 1. again.</li>
</ol>
<p>This could eat up a whole lot of time. The process is now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write initial document draft</li>
<li>Invite collaborators, edit and dicuss in realtime</li>
</ol>
<p>How many hours or days does this save?</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cloud9-ide-realtime-coding-collabroation.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We can take this experience to coding. In this case we have <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9 IDE</a>, an in-browser collaborative code editor. Using C9 we can have multiple developers editing and discussing code, and we can also jump into a <strong>collaborative debugging session</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/murally-realtime-murals.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, we can take an experience which usually requires physical space - think whiteboarding. Murally offer an app that lets multiple users collaborate on large open murals where you can bring in text, pictures and annotations. A great way of exploring and fleshing out ideas.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/realtime-use-case-summary.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are many uses of realtime technology but the most common use cases are live content, notifications, activity streams, chat, collaborative experience and games.</p>
<p>As we start to innovate futher I'm sure this list will continue to expand - I didn't even touch on the <strong>Internet of Things where realtime web tech is going to be massively important</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="next:-fundamentals-of-realtime-and-realtime-functionality"><a href="#next:-fundamentals-of-realtime-and-realtime-functionality">Next: Fundamentals of Realtime and Realtime Functionality</a></h2>
<p>That's it for part 1. In part 2 I'll cover the fundamentals of realtime and realtime functionality. Finally, in part 3 I'll cover 5 points that you should consider when <strong>Choosing your Realtime Web App Tech Stack</strong>.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/10/18/the-current-state-of-realtime-web-tech-for-php.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/php-logo.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/php-logo.png" alt="PHP Logo" width="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-24009" /></a></p>
<p>I quite frequently see posts on StackOverflow about how to add realtime functionality to a PHP application, or to build a realtime solution with PHP. And I'm increasingly getting emails asking the same. So, here's what I feel the current state of Realtime Web Technology is for PHP:</p>
<p><strong>The solutions for PHP alone are very limited</strong>. There is a framework called <a href="http://reactphp.org/">ReactPHP</a> on top of which Chris Boden has built <a href="http://socketo.me">Ratchet</a>. I've also come across something called <a href="https://github.com/chrisnetonline/WaterSpout-Server">WaterSpout Server</a> which claims to offer WebSockets and HTTP fallback, but I haven't tried it out.</p>
<p>However, as per the book I co-authored with Jason Lengstorf - <a href="http://realtimewebapps.com">Realtime Web Apps</a> - and the articles I've written for Web &amp; PHP (<a href="http://webandphp.com/UnderstandingRealtimePHPApps-166085">Understanding Realtime PHP Apps</a> and <a href="http://webandphp.com/BuildingRealtimeWebAppswithPHP-166928">Building Realtime Web Apps with PHP</a>) the best solution right now is either to use a <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide#hosted-services">realtime hosted service</a> or to have a non-PHP solution running in parallel. Lee Boynton wrote a nice article for Web &amp; PHP on integrating <a href="http://webandphp.com/IntegratingNode.jswithPHP">Node.JS with PHP</a> and the Ratchet documentation provides information on <a href="http://socketo.me/docs/push">integrating a realtime solution into a LAMP stack using message queues</a>.</p>
<p>If you know of any other solutions, or believe differently, please get in touch.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[The JavaScript Weekly Effect]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/09/21/the-javascript-weekly-effect.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/09/21/the-javascript-weekly-effect.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Monday we published our <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org/2013/09/16/introducing-bladerunnerjs/">first BladeRunnerJS (BRJS) blog post</a>. It provides an overview of what BRJS is, why it was created and why it's being open sourced. We saw a nice spike in traffic and I was thinking about ways I could try to sustain that. I decided not to take any action (e.g. submit for consideration in JavaScript Weekly) for two reasons; we'd publish plenty more posts over the coming weeks and we don't have any source in <a href="https://github.com/bladerunnerjs/brjs">github</a> right now. It would therefore be much better to focus on getting traffic when there's actually a solution that people can download and try out.</p>

<p><strong>Then, on Friday, <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/archive/148.html">JavaScript Weekly issue 148</a> came out</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-stats"><a href="#the-stats">The Stats</a></h3>
<p>Some stats for 20th - 21st September, covering around a 24 hours period after JavaScript Weekly came out are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1248 Unique visits</li>
<li>29 mailing list registrations</li>
<li>Around +6 github repo watchers</li>
<li>Around +10 github repo stargazers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, <strong>I'm not saying these are absolutely amazing stats</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brjs-google-analytics-1024x675.png" alt="BRJS Google Analytics" width="1024" height="675" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23958" /></p>
<p>But, a <strong>2% converstion of site hits to mailing list registrations</strong> for a project with only a single blog post, an empty github repo and a <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">landing page</a> available, is actually pretty good. <em>Hopefully it also means the post was quite interesting too!</em></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brjs-mailchimp-emails-1024x538.png" alt="BRJS signup notifications" width="1024" height="538" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23959" /></p>
<p>Beyond that, the other 964 <span style="text-decoration: line-through">visitors</span> <em>developers</em> who have an interest in JavaScript toolkits and frameworks will have at least heard of <strong>BladeRunnerJS</strong> now.</p>
<p>We now need to build on that by - primarily - open-sourcing a quality solution, and then demonstrating its value by continuing to publish interesting content (tutorials, updates and through provoking JavaScript software engineering practices) on our blog.</p>
<h3 id="the-javascript-weekly-readership"><a href="#the-javascript-weekly-readership">The JavaScript Weekly Readership</a></h3>
<p>I've had a few links published in JavaScript Weekly and I've always seen a tremendous amount of traffic and signups/conversions from the newsletter. I believe that's because it has a readership who are used to receiving a highly focused and well-curated service. Kudos to <a href="http://peterc.org/">Peter Cooper</a> and <a href="http://www.2ality.com/">Dr. Axel Rauschmayer</a> for keeping the quality high and for managing to track everything that's going on in the seriously fast moving world of JavaScript.</p>
<p><em>Note: I've just realised I've probably upped the prices we'll have to pay to <a href="https://cooperpress.com/mediakit2013.pdf">advertise in JavaScript Weekly</a> :)</em></p>

      <title><![CDATA[Web Development Pic 'n' Mix]]></title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/07/18/web-development-pic-n-mix.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past three weeks I've had the opportunity to investigate modern web development tools and I feel a little bit like a kid in a sweet shop. Firstly, I'm excited to be here. Secondly, there's so much to choose from. In the past you may have been able to pick up a selection box containing a few pre-defined dev tool options. Now, there are so many technologies and tools available it's like being in the pic 'n' mix section.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pic-n-mix.jpg" alt="pic-n-mix" width="640" height="349" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23921" /><br />
<small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/20989733@N00/61985179/">source</a></small></p>
<p>There are so many tools to choose from when undertaking a web development project that it's difficult to know where to get started. How do you approach choosing what's right for your project? How can you really know without trying them all out?</p>
<p>Let's be honest; very few of us have time to really try out everything.</p>
<p>So, you probably choose techniques, technologies and tools that have similarities to the ones you are familiar with, the ones used and talked about by those you 'follow' and from selective reading and testing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Node.js is trending; we should probably try that out"</p>
<p>"We can now loosely couple our web front-ends from our backends thanks to modern browsers and by building APIs"</p>
<p>"I'm seeing Yeoman mentioned a lot and those guys from Google are involved in it; that must be the way to go"</p>
<p>"I've seen people migrating from TextMate to Sublime; we should be using Sublime".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From runtime to editor; it's a minefield that has to be navigated quite frequently as technology naturally progresses at an amazing rate.</p>
<p>A lot of us (developers) like to have the choice. We like picking the pieces of technology that suit us. Our development workflow really is created from a pic 'n' mix of tools; from runtimes, to productivity apps, to editors, to build tools, and beyond!</p>
<p>IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) were commonplace in the not too distant past. But now, and for quite some time - in the scripted-language circles I've been in, anyway - there has been little use of IDEs and the choice has been to pic 'n' mix web development tooling. There are obvious benefits in being able to select small tools that do one (or a few things) very well.</p>
<p>Editors: Sublime, TextMate or Vim combined with editor customisations and hooks into the terminal/console represent a common web development setup. The terminal is then used to kick off tasks from running tests to full builds and deployments. Certainly no pointing and clicking.</p>
<p>The real need for effort comes when those tools - executed from the terminal - have to integrate with each other. Scripts have to be written, tested, debugged and managed in the very same way as the code for the product that's being built. It feels like we're spending more and more time playing with tooling and less time creating products. Others seem to agree.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Relatedly: I&#39;m often concerned that the web industry is getting way too hung up on techniques/tooling than the actual product/thing itself.</p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Andrews (@mattpointblank) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattpointblank/statuses/356899458384019456">July 15, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><small>Also see Matt's post, <a href="http://www.threechords.org/blog/the-web-less-engine-more-gas/">The web: less engine, more gas</a></small></p>
<p>Some developers - and businesses - simply want a set of web development tools, and a runtime stack, that just works and helps productivity as close to "out of the box" as possible. This may be through buying-in to a technology stack such as the ones provided by Microsoft (whether you like it or not, Visual Studio is a solid IDE and developers can be very productive using it) or by using a <strong>web toolkit</strong> which consists of a collection of small tools pre-configured in a way that has been agreed by the toolkit's contributors to be a productive default.</p>
<p>When it comes to front-end web development, the latter can be seen in the likes of <a href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a>, <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a>, <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/lineman">lineman</a> and <a href="http://mimosajs.com/">Mimosa</a>.</p>
<p>These don't provide editors, but do provide things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>default application structure (skeletons) from templates</li>
<li>scaffolding functionality to help generate common files for common functionality (e.g. models, views, controllers and tests)</li>
<li>development runtime tools (e.g server and logging)</li>
<li>a common build process</li>
</ul>
<p>They also generally provide some sort of plugin or extension support. Exactly what can be customised by these really depends on the toolkit; Yeoman appears to be massively flexible while Mimosa is a little more restrictive.</p>
<p>You could still look upon these toolkits as being too flexible, or as requiring too much additional configuration, but the defaults are consistently being reviewed - Yeoman only at 1.0 release candidate 1.</p>
<p>So, is there still a place for the full blown IDE? Maybe that depends on the technology that an application is being built on; Visual Studio for .NET and IntelliJ, NetBeans or Eclipse for Java versus text editors (TextMate, Sublime and Vim) plus customised tooling for Node.js, Ruby and front-end technologies like JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Less etc.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in Yeoman. It's already had great take-up by a community that live on the cutting edge and has had a large number of contributions. It consists of <a href="gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> which both have a high level of adoption on their own. What interests me is that I can see a number of light weight wrappers being created around these tools to provide more defined (rigid/opinionated) developer workflows that fit certain work environments or where some development processes need to be adhered to; maybe the types of environment that IDEs presently inhabit? This may require an acceptance of Node.js in larger institutions, but I think that's coming and is certainly being helped by Microsoft's adoption of it and incorporation in Windows Azure.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/selection-box.jpg" alt="selection-box" width="640" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23924" /><br />
<small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skrb/5984295645/sizes/z/in/photostream/">source</a></small></p>
<p>Would the wider, more cutting edge community, adopt a more defined workflow if it were proven to help productivity and could demonstrate that using it resulted in quality scalable web applications?</p>
<p>Pic 'n' mix web development tooling is popular right now, but maybe the day will come when a number of proven quality selection box developer toolkits - consisting of the very best of the pic 'n' mix - will return to popularity?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Around 3 months ago I made the very difficult decision to leave <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>. After just over 2 years I'm leaving behind what - up until now - has been the best job I've ever had.</p>

<p>In this post I'll cover what's been achieved while I've been at Pusher, why I left and what I'm going to be doing next.</p>
<h2 id="achievements"><a href="#achievements">Achievements</a></h2>
<p>Over the past 2 years Pusher has achieved a lot and I believe I've made a good contribution towards that. But, here I'm focusing on what I've done in my role as Developer Evangelist for Pusher.</p>

<p>I've just compiled these stats and I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved. I'm particularly surprised to see I've given <strong>31 talks</strong>.</p>
<p>For a sample of the sort of thing I got up to in a year have a look at my <a href="/2012/05/20/a-year-as-a-developer-evangelist.html">year as a Developer Evangelist blog post</a> from mid-2012.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-left-pusher"><a href="#why-i-left-pusher">Why I left Pusher</a></h2>
<p>My last official day at Pusher was 18th June 2013. But, I also attended the EE Hackathon on 22/23 June representing Pusher. So, I still have a great relationship with everybody there.</p>
<p>I'm leaving simply because I've had a great 2 years and now it's time for a new challenge. Sorry, no scandal to be found here. Pusher is still awesome!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamyeats">Adam Yeats</a> has joined Pusher to take on a lot of what I previously did. He's very excited about his new role and I'm sure he'll really enjoy it. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/adamyeats">give him some love on Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-next?"><a href="#what-next?">What Next?</a></h2>
<p>My work focus is now two-fold.</p>
<h3 id="realtime"><a href="#realtime">Realtime</a></h3>
<p>I'm still very passionate about <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">Realtime Web Technologies</a> so I'm going to continue evangelising about how they can be used to create interactive and engaging experiences. The only difference now is that I won't be so focused on Pusher, and will be covering realtime web technologies more generally.</p>
<p><a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2013/schedule/stage-1/"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fowa-talk.png" alt="fowa-talk" width="649" height="372" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23897" /></a></p>
<p>I'm going to be speaking at <a href="http://hackference.co.uk/">Hackference</a> in Birmingham in August and at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2013/">FOWA 2013</a> in October about uses of realtime web technologies.</p>
<h3 id="bladerunnerjs"><a href="#bladerunnerjs">BladeRunnerJS</a></h3>
<p>Over the past couple of years I've done less development, and specifically less advanced JavaScript development. Instead I've been focusing on demonstrating simple but powerful use cases for realtime web technologies using JavaScript. Since the JavaScript adoption and innovation has been so fast-paced over the past two years I need to play a bit of catchup.</p>
<p><a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bladerunner-js.png" alt="bladerunner-js" width="555" height="116" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23895" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">BladeRunnerJS</a> is the perfect opportunity for me to continue in a role that I love and also start learning, creating and sharing about a technology that I've been using since graduating from university in 2001.</p>
<p>BladeRunnerJS is a component developed by <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a> (who I've worked for twice before) and I've been asked to lead the team to <strong>open source</strong> the component.</p>
<p>If you are interested in building HTML5/JavaScript web applications and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tookits such as <a href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/lineman">lineman</a>, <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">middleman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/anviljs/anvil.js/">Anvil</a>, <a href="http://mimosajs.com/">mimosa</a></li>
<li>Frameworks like <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a></li>
<li>Creating complex single page applications that scale by following good software engineering practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Then BladeRunnerJS will be of interest to you. Please head on over to <a href="http://bladerunnerjs.org">bladerunnerjs.org</a> and register for the mailing list or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/BladeRunnerJS">@BladeRunnerJS</a> to stay tuned.</p>
<h3 id="goodbye-pusher,-hello-bladerunnerjs"><a href="#goodbye-pusher,-hello-bladerunnerjs">Goodbye Pusher, hello BladeRunnerJS</a></h3>
<p>A final thanks to everybody at Pusher for a fantastic two years. And thanks to Caplin Systems for asking me to help with BladeRunnerJS. It's going to be an awesome ride!</p>

<small>Feature image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haggismac/">Sean Loyless</a></small></p>
<p>I've been to quite a few conferences over the last couple of years (46 conferences and events, by my count). <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/converge-edinburgh/">Converge Conference</a> was something different. Although a tech conference, the focus in the talks I saw was most definitely on soft skills and experiences, and not really on the tech. This was highly refreshing.</p>
<p>There were 3 talks in particular that resonated with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>All of a sudden ... no luck! by <a href="http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk">Rachel Andrew</a> - <em>more information below</em>.</li>
<li>Enterprise Porridge by <a href="https://twitter.com/girlgeeks">Morna Simpson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jaz303/how-to-fake-it-for-18-months-and-almost-launch-a-hardware-product">How to fake it for 18 months and (almost) launch a hardware product</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaz303">Jason Frame</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the blog post title suggests, I'm going to focus on providing technical customer support. But I'd like to provide a bit of information about the other talks.</p>
<p>Morna spoke about the state of trying to get funding from public bodies such as <a href="http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/">Scottish Enterprise</a>. Basically it sucks! I've experience of this myself as I'm helping a friend work on a startup in Scotland called Bee Found. I believe Morna is going to write this up so I'll leave it there.</p>
<p>Jason spoke about building a hardware product; but more than that, he spoke about how he's a creative person who as previously failed to deliver. He spoke about how he now understands himself and can then create goals which will mean he's a much better chance of finishing things, where he previously would lose interest and stop. A really interesting talk with a personal story which made it all the better.</p>
<p>On to the main topic; thoughts on providing technical customer support:</p>
<h2 id="tech-support-experiences"><a href="#tech-support-experiences">Tech Support Experiences</a></h2>
<p>I've heard a lot about Rachel Andrew, but never seen her talk before. It was just luck that in this case she was talking about something I've spent a <strong>very</strong> large amount of the last two years at <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> doing; <strong>Customer Support</strong> - a key part in the customer service within a SaaS. The talk was very well delivered and due to my relevant experience this talk really hit home.</p>
<p>Here are a few extracts (the headings) from <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rachelandrew/converge-edinburgh-all-of-a-sudden-dot-dot-dot-no-luck">Rachel's slides</a> and some thoughts around them.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“value-of-amazing-customer-support””&gt;&lt;a href=”#”value-of-amazing-customer-support””&gt;”Value of amazing customer support”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>We all know the value of great customer support; it's not just an opportunity to help a customer with a problem but also one to build a relationship. A relationship is a two way thing and if a good one is created it can result in loyalty and referrals.</p>
<p>Support can be amazing in terms of both quality and also speed of response. Sometimes just letting a customer know that you're going to look into something with a reasonable timeline is enough. And make sure you follow up when you said you would.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“one-customer-well-taken-care-of-could-be-worth-more-than-$10,000-worth-of-advertising”—jim-rohn”&gt;&lt;a href=”#”one-customer-well-taken-care-of-could-be-worth-more-than-$10,000-worth-of-advertising”—jim-rohn”&gt;”One customer well taken care of could be worth more than $10,000 worth of advertising” - Jim Rohn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/money-grey-e1370517030133.jpg" alt="money-grey" width="640" height="233" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23853" /><br />
<small>By <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/">Thomas Hawk</a></small></p>
<p>This continues on from the idea of referrals.</p>
<p>But, how do you know which customers are going to offer you that kind of ROI? Can and should you treat customers differently depending on the potential ROI?</p>
<p>At the end of Rachel's talk I asked her if they in any way look at who a customer is when providing support and if they take that into consideration. She said they treat all customers the same. But, she did say that they do build up relationships and get to know customers. And Perch, the product she created and provides support for, works with a licensing model so they know any real support request - rather than a pre-sales query - is from a paying customer.</p>
<p>I think this can be really difficult subject; if you can associate a support request with a customer then you may already have a relationship with them, they may be on a higher paid plan, they may have purchased lots of licences, or they may have paid extra for premium support. But if you don't know who the customer is then should you do anything to prioritise incoming support queries? Unless some kind of support process is clearly defined and communicated to those making a support query should you treat all support requests the same? Even if you have one support request from dave@somecoolbrand.com and one from xqz2010@gmail.com?</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“support-is-something-people-pay-for””&gt;&lt;a href=”#”support-is-something-people-pay-for””&gt;”Support is something people pay for”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>I've already mentioned this above. But it's worth highlighting that many products and services do make support a premium part of a licence or the service.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“customer-service-is-the-new-marketing”—derek-sivers”&gt;&lt;a href=”#”customer-service-is-the-new-marketing”—derek-sivers”&gt;”Customer service is the new marketing” - Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/market.jpg" alt="market" width="600" height="249" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23861" /><br />
<small>By <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spotsgot/">Camille King</a></small></p>
<p>For me, <a href="http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> got this before anybody else. He was talking about <a href="/2009/12/09/how-real-time-does-real-time-have-to-be.html">small town rules</a> back in 2009 and little has changed. Probably before then.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that I've heard about big brands jumping on this, finding it too difficult (to measure ROI or really manage it), and then reduce their focus. I still think this is <strong>massively important</strong>. If I was involved in managing the social media process for a large company I'd have a large - well paid and trained - team handling social media.</p>
<p>As a company grows, managing this does become more difficult. But it's worth it.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“creating-data-on-support-helps-you-plan-for-growth””&gt;&lt;a href=”#”creating-data-on-support-helps-you-plan-for-growth””&gt;”Creating data on support helps you plan for growth”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>The main thing I took away from this point is the importance of support analytics. At Pusher we use <a href="http://tenderapp.com">Tender</a> which, unfortunately, doesn't have great reporting. The reporting features has been in beta since I joined Pusher, 2 years ago.</p>
<p>At Perch, they use <a href="http://www.helpspot.com/">Help Spot</a> and it looks to provide good reporting. I also think <a href="http://zendesk.com">Zendesk</a> looks like it provides good reporting.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“i-get-support-tickets-that-are-nothing-short-of-extortion”—andrey-butov”&gt;&lt;a href=”#”i-get-support-tickets-that-are-nothing-short-of-extortion”—andrey-butov”&gt;”I get support tickets that are nothing short of extortion” - Andrey Butov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>Don't threaten the people you are in touch with on support. Yes, they do represent the service or production you are annoyed with. But, while it may get an initial response, it won't help you - the customer - build a good <a href="/2012/09/14/b2b-services-everybody-is-a-potential-customer.html">relationship with your service provider</a>.</p>
<h4 id="feature-requests-and-product-focus"><a href="#feature-requests-and-product-focus">Feature requests and product focus</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>"The trouble with feature requests"</p>
<p>"Protect the core use case of your product"</p>
<p>"Add features that benefit the majority, not the noisy minority"</p>
<p>"Customer support can be your best market research"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some companies and services that provide a public roadmap of features. If the things on the roadmap aren't met then it annoys people. This is especially the case if a customer has built something they relied on being delivered as it was in the roadmap.</p>
<p>So, not providing a public roadmap may be easier. But, how do you measure demand for features? Do you simply note them somewhere internally? How do you ensure all feedback is captured?</p>
<p>The benefit of a public roadmap, and public feature requests, is that it's easier to capture demand. There's less need for an internal process to do this.</p>
<p>But, how do you ensure that users don't jump on a feature that you don't feel fits with your core product vision? If you have a public roadmap, you can't.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“design-support-our-of-your-product””&gt;&lt;a href=”#”design-support-our-of-your-product””&gt;”Design support our of your product”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> this idea. We all know this, but we don't spend enough time improving things.</p>
<p>If you think about support processes at the moment it generally goes like this:</p>
<p><code>Try feature in product -&gt; doesn't work -&gt; get error message -&gt; user contacts support</code></p>
<p>At the point where the user is at <code>get error message</code> they should be able to solve the problem. If they they instead <code>user contacts support</code> then your error message isn't good enough. The error message should tell the user how to solve the problem. The process should be:</p>
<p><code>Try feature in product -&gt; doesn't work -&gt; get informative error message -&gt; user fixes problem</code></p>
<p>Rachel's example was:</p>
<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2F0T3E1W1U2G0F0M0d2P/bad-message.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3u1h0Q1D1G16170O1E3d/better-message.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Simple, but effective. The same goes for API error messages.</p>
<p><strong>Perch don't have FAQs</strong> because they believe so much in <em>designing support out of your product</em>.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“provide-a-variety-of-help-material,-different-levels-and-formats””&gt;&lt;a href=”#”provide-a-variety-of-help-material,-different-levels-and-formats””&gt;”Provide a variety of help material, different levels and formats”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>Different users approach doing things in different ways. Some like to read tutorials or developer guides, others like API references and there may also be a preference for screencasts.</p>
<p>The more options you have the more chance you have of satisfying all users. This can be time consuming, but it may be worth considering.</p>
<p>&lt;h4 id=”“it’s-not-working””&gt;&lt;a href=”#”it’s-not-working””&gt;”It’s not working”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>OMFG! RTFM! Sorry, I mean "I'm sorry your experiencing problems. Could you please…"</p>
<p>If you've ever handled support before then you'll know what this is. If you've ever submitted a support request like this then, think about it!</p>
<p>When submitting a support request you have to provide as much information as possible to help the person providing support solve the problem you are seeing.</p>
<p>Support systems should help ensure that the important information related to the problem is captured. At Pusher I broke the support categories down based on what a customer may be trying to achieve</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting - I can't connect</li>
<li>Subscribing - problem with subscribing to channels</li>
<li>Publishing - publishing information either from the server or client</li>
<li>Account/Billing - stuff related to plans, billing etc.</li>
<li>etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea. For each of these I'd really have liked to had specific fields for important information related to that category; what's your <code>app_id</code>? what library are you using? What debug information do you have? I'm sure this will be built into the support system in the future.</p>
<p>Lots to think about in this talk. I highly recommend you have a look over <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rachelandrew/converge-edinburgh-all-of-a-sudden-dot-dot-dot-no-luck">Rachel's slides</a> for further insights.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2013/04/09/windows-mobile-service-realtime-collaborative-todo.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the first two talks at <a href="http://stacked.thestack.co.uk/">#stacked13</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaulty">Mike Taulty</a> and then <a href="https://twitter.com/maartenballiauw">Maarten Balliauw</a> I thought I'd jump straight into Windows Azure Mobile Services and build an a <strong>realtime collaborative synchronised todo list</strong>. I'd do this based on the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-html/">Get started with data in Mobile Services HTML guide</a>. I would then and host it on a <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/">Windows Azure web site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update: <em>Sorry, I haven't renewed my Azure Mobile Services account so the demo is no longer available</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/realtime-todo.png" alt="realtime-todo" width="800" height="357" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23756" /></p>
<p style="text-decoration: line-through">View the demo</p>
<p><em>Note: I want to publish this quite quickly so that people at the event can have a play. So, the rest of this post will be a bit of a brain dump and I'll tidy it up later</em></p>
<h3 id="html/javascript-mobile-services-to-do-list"><a href="#html/javascript-mobile-services-to-do-list">HTML/JavaScript Mobile Services To Do list</a></h3>
<p>In Mike's talk he mentioned that the mobile service JavaScript library has just been released. So, this was an obvious starting point. Signing up for Azure and following the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-html/">getting started</a> guide was very simple.</p>
<p>You can see the code following the tutorial, with a bit of clean up, <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/tree/bf07e3c0ec944f5ed74096cc1d748f5e26cd5cda">here</a>. The main files to look at are <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/blob/bf07e3c0ec944f5ed74096cc1d748f5e26cd5cda/index.html">index.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/blob/bf07e3c0ec944f5ed74096cc1d748f5e26cd5cda/app.js">app.js</a>.</p>
<h3 id="making-it-realtime-with-pusher"><a href="#making-it-realtime-with-pusher">Making it realtime with Pusher</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> (who I work for) are <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/service/?id=70e4389b-739e-4c8a-9af2-411fb11b895a">listed in the Windows Azure store</a>. So, the first thing to do is add Pusher as an add-on.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-azure-addon-e1365510019790.png" alt="pusher-azure-addon" width="997" height="665" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23750" /></p>
<p>Once the addon has been created you go to the Pusher Dashboard and grab your application credentials from the already created "Azure" application.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-api-access.png" alt="pusher-api-access" width="830" height="357" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23753" /></p>
<p>Once I had the Pusher addon ready and my credentials I could jump into data scripts and so that <strong>any changes to the todo list could instantly be broadcast to anybody else viewing the list</strong>.</p>
<p>The code for this is unbelievably simple. The fact the <em>insert</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>delete</em> scripts are all separate makes things a bit repetitive, but ultimately you can broadcast the change events in just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>&lt;h3 id=”broadcasting-c&lt;span-style=”text-decoration:-line-through;”&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;ud-trigger-events”&gt;&lt;a href=”#broadcasting-c&lt;span-style=”text-decoration:-line-through;”&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;ud-trigger-events”&gt;Broadcasting C<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">R</span>UD Trigger events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-insert-1024x639.png" alt="pusher-insert" width="1024" height="639" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23762" /></p>
<p>The first thing that we do in the script is include the <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-node-server">pusher-node-server library</a> which Microsoft have made available because Pusher is in the Windows Azure Store.</p>
<p>We then create a new <code>Pusher</code> instance and provide it with our credentials.</p>
<p>After that we let the <code>INSERT</code> complete and if it is successful we trigger an event on a <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/channels">channel</a> to broadcast that a new todo list item has been created. The first parameter here is the name of the channel, the second the name of the event (what happened) and the third is the data payload. You also need to wait for the request to complete in order for the <code>item</code> to have an <code>id</code> property.</p>
<p>Adding <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> scripts were just as easy.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-update-1024x640.png" alt="pusher-update" width="1024" height="640" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23763" /></p>
<p>The <code>item</code> in the <code>UPDATE</code> script only has the changed properties. I had to modify my front-end JavaScript because of this.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-delete-1024x638.png" alt="pusher-delete" width="1024" height="638" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23767" /></p>
<p>You only get the <code>id</code> of the item that was deleted in the <code>DELETE</code> do you need to create an object with an <code>id</code> property e.g. <code>{ id: 'some_id'}</code></p>
<h3 id="are-the-events-being-triggered"><a href="#are-the-events-being-triggered">Are the events being triggered</a></h3>
<p>You can check to see if events are being triggered by using the existing application, which doe cause the scripts to be executed, and then view the <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/debugging#pusher_debug_console">Pusher Debug Console</a></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-debug-console.png" alt="pusher-debug-console" width="811" height="474" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23776" /></p>
<h3 id="making-the-front-end-realtime"><a href="#making-the-front-end-realtime">Making the front-end realtime</a></h3>
<p><code>app.js</code> relied quite heavily on a function called <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/blob/bf07e3c0ec944f5ed74096cc1d748f5e26cd5cda/app.js#L7-L26"><code>refreshTodoItems</code></a>. <strong>Yuck!</strong> every time something happens in the application this function would query the Windows Azure Mobile data service to get all the new data. Why do this when you can just instantly push the changes to the client as they happen?!</p>
<p>If you'd prefer to read the code to see the changes you can do that via the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d">"goodbye refresh, hello Pusher"</a> commit which shows all the changes I made.</p>
<p>But, here are a few details.</p>
<h3 id="the-pusher-js-script-tag"><a href="#the-pusher-js-script-tag">The pusher-js script tag</a></h3>
<p>A simple include:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L1R34"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-js.png" alt="pusher-js" width="930" height="150" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23768" /></a></p>
<h3 id="create-a-pusher-instance,-subscribe-and-bind"><a href="#create-a-pusher-instance,-subscribe-and-bind">Create a Pusher instance, subscribe and bind</a></h3>
<p>You create a new <code>Pusher</code> instance and pass in your <code>app_key</code>. Doing this connects your app to Pusher.</p>
<p>You also identify that we're interested in changes to the <code>todo</code> list - you'll have seen that we were triggering on the <code>todo</code> channel in the mobile data services script.</p>
<p>For each type of event (<code>insert</code>, <code>update</code> and <code>delete</code>) that we expect on the channel and have a different function handle each of these.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L0R14"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pusher-instance-channels.png" alt="pusher-instance-channels" width="926" height="137" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23770" /></a></p>
<h3 id="handle-create-events"><a href="#handle-create-events">Handle create events</a></h3>
<p>When a new item is created we need to insert it into the existing list:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L0R41"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/create-insert.png" alt="create-insert" width="928" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23772" /></a></p>
<p>The <code>createItem</code> function actually create a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and the <code>insertItem</code> function actually appends it to the view. We also reuse <code>createItem</code> function in the function that we renamed <code>refreshTodoItems</code> (<strong>Yuck!</strong>) to - <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L0R21"><code>initTodoItems</code></a>. This means we only query the mobile service endpoint once when the app initial loads - <strong>Win!</strong>. Notice how many times I got to delete <code>refreshTodoItems</code> in <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L0L47">the commit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="handle-update-events"><a href="#handle-update-events">Handle update events</a></h3>
<p>Because only the updated data is sent to the <code>update</code> handler this function is a bit bigger than I would have liked. We simply check to see what data is present in the update and then change the list as required:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L0R61"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/update-item.png" alt="update-item" width="930" height="275" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23773" /></a></p>
<h3 id="handle-delete-events"><a href="#handle-delete-events">Handle delete events</a></h3>
<p>The delete event handler is passed an <code>item</code> with an <code>id</code> property. We simply find the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> in the view with this <code>id</code>, slide it out of view and then remove it from the DOM.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/4b4d6157c965c80de71a5798daaba68c4c03ee6d#L0R77"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/delete-item.png" alt="delete-item" width="928" height="131" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23775" /></a></p>
<h3 id="it's-now-realtime"><a href="#it's-now-realtime">It's now realtime</a></h3>
<p>If you now use the app, any time somebody else makes a change it'll instantly be broadcast to anybody else viewing the application.</p>
<p>Next, to deploy it to Windows Azure Web Sites</p>
<h3 id="windows-azure-web-sites"><a href="#windows-azure-web-sites">Windows Azure Web Sites</a></h3>
<p>Creating a Windows Azure Web Site is a piece of cake!</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/create-website.png" alt="create-website" width="1163" height="252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23778" /></p>
<p>In the following dialog make sure you check the "Publish from source control" checkbox. You can then choose to either sync with an existing github repo (very cool) or use a git repo and push to it. A nice simple tutorial on this can be found in the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/common-tasks/publishing-with-git/">Publishing from Source Control to Windows Azure Web Sites guide</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/create-publish-source.png" alt="create-publish-source" width="713" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23777" /></p>
<p>Add the remote repo locally using <code>git remote add azure &lt;repo_url&gt;</code>, then you can push to use using <code>git push azure master</code>. The Windows Azure portal actually updates straight away to show that the app has been deployed:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/push-to-azure.png" alt="push-to-azure" width="1076" height="327" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23780" /></p>
<p>The app is now live - <strong>or is it?</strong> It's <strong>GOTCHA</strong> time.</p>
<h3 id="gotchas"><a href="#gotchas">Gotchas</a></h3>
<h4 id=".js-in-root-directory-=-node.js-env-detection"><a href="#.js-in-root-directory-=-node.js-env-detection">.js in root directory = node.js env detection</a></h4>
<p>The first gotcha I came across was that it seem like the environment detection assumes your app is a Node.js app if you have a <code>js</code> file in the root directory. To get around this I had to <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/020527f2282455ac7fd064dd2a7e5c4ae1e5a3ef">move <code>app.js</code> to <code>js/app.js</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="cross-scheme-and-origin-(cors)-communication"><a href="#cross-scheme-and-origin-(cors)-communication">Cross scheme and Origin (CORS) communication</a></h4>
<p>Browsers implement rules that mean you can't communicate cross scheme: http &lt;-&gt; https. So, make sure that the app/web page and the assets (JavaScript) are all <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-azure-todo/commit/30323655fc31c9c9cb6fed0c6b2e930c855a21de">served from the same scheme</a>.</p>
<p>One final thing you need to do is allow access from a given domain via the configuration for your mobile services. I came across this right at the end and nearly cried when I didn't think it was going to happen. But, unsurprisingly **the Gu* <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/03/18/windows-azure-new-hadoop-service-html5-js-cors-phonegap-mercurial-and-dropbox-support.aspx">came to the rescue</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cors-config.png" alt="cors-config" width="925" height="334" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23781" /></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>It would appear that CORS settings can get out of sync:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Just noticed the the CORS settings for an <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Azure">#Azure</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23MobileServices">#MobileServices</a> app got out of sync. CORS wasn't working so I had to edit &amp; save to re-sync</p>

<h3 id="tada---i-mean-todo!"><a href="#tada---i-mean-todo!">Tada - I mean TODO!</a></h3>
<p>We no have a To Do list that multiple users can collaborate on and instantly see the changes as they happen. The back-end is powered by <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>, the realtime communication is achieved using <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> and the app/site is hosted on a <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/">Windows Azure Web Site</a>.</p>
<p>Not bad for a few hours work whilst at Stacked13! What are you waiting for? Start playing with the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">realtime collaborative Windows Azure Mobile Service To Do app</span>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>First I'd like to emphasise that this is a blog post on <strong>how</strong> and <strong>not why</strong>. The why comes down to the judges. So, thanks Judges! Secondly I'd like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/robdunfey">Rob Dunfey</a> for the idea and for providing additional motivation - I'll dig deeper into this later. Finally: what am I going to cover? As the title suggests, I want to cover the <strong>how</strong>.</em></p>

<p>What that means is:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>The Idea</em></li>
<li><em>Solving a Real Problem</em></li>
<li><em>The Motivation</em></li>
<li><em>A Developer's Toolbox?</em></li>
<li><em>My Developer's Toolbox - How the Realtime Collaborative Mapping app was built</em></li>
<li><em>What has been achieved?</em></li>
<li><em>Where next?</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-idea"><a href="#the-idea">The Idea</a></h3>
<p class="alignright size-full"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/robs-brain-287x300.jpg" alt="Rob&#039;s Brain" width="287" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-23711" /><br />Rob's Brain</p>
<p>I've been friends with <a href="https://twitter.com/robdunfey">Rob Dunfey</a> ever since I worked at ESRI back in 2005. When I worked there my job title became "GIS Consultant" but if I'm honest I was really only ever a Web Developer (<em>that's not a bad thing</em>). Since then we've worked on a couple of projects together - Rob now works as a Geo-Information Consultant at Shell and I'm a "Developer Evangelist" at <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>. I'm following my passion for <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide">Realtime Web Technologies</a> and web development, and Rob is following his passion for GIS.</p>
<p>However, we do infrequently work on projects together and, to be honest, it's sometimes quite difficult to get Rob to slow down with his ideas about using GIS to solve real problems. One of the things he also sees is the opportunity to use web technologies to solve those problems.</p>
<p>So, two weeks ago Rob got in touch with me - <em>not to discuss his impending wedding on Monday</em> - but to tell me about the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js">100 Lines or Less ArcGIS JavaScript Code Challenge</a>!</p>
<h3 id="solving-real-problem"><a href="#solving-real-problem">Solving Real Problem</a></h3>
<p>Rob said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frequently we encounter a business problem that requires a solution enabling multiple colleagues capture information on a map at the same time, in a dynamic fashion.  One such use case may be a workshop event, where you want to capture locations favoured by attendees - you could try that at the Palm Springs dev summit, if you ask attendees to mark up a map with their home location, all done real time, allowing the conversation to develop around the map edits - real time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've seen the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/README.md">README</a> for my <a href="http://esri.github.com/100-lines-or-less-js/realtime-collaborative-mapping/index.html">Realtime Collaborative Mapping</a> entry you'll notice that the introductory paragraph is almost identical to this.</p>
<p>The ability to collaboratively edit a map in realtime had clearly been identified as something that people really want - and need - to do: A problem that needed to be solved.</p>
<p><strong>Could this be done in 100 lines of JavaScript or less?</strong> Yes.</p>
<h3 id="the-motivation"><a href="#the-motivation">The Motivation</a></h3>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2-person-collaboration-300x286.jpg" alt="2-person-collaboration" width="300" height="286" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-23737" /></p>
<p>To succeed at something it's important to be motivated. I'd like to think that in this case the motivation behind the <a href="http://esri.github.com/100-lines-or-less-js/realtime-collaborative-mapping/index.html">Realtime Collaborative Mapping application</a> really helped ensure that the result was successful.</p>
<p>If you combine my knowledge of realtime web technologies with Rob's knowledge of GIS then the most obvious use case is a realtime collaborative mapping application. So, we've been discussing this idea for quite some time. This competition was the perfect platform to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">get Rob off my back</span> <strong>prove that the idea we've been bouncing around for months could be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p>And not only could it be achieved it <strong>could be done in 100 lines of JavaScript or less</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, I've been working with realtime web technologies for over 10 years now and I saw this as a great opportunity to <strong>demonstrate the power of realtime web technologies</strong>. And to demonstrate that <strong>using realtime web technologies is really easy</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="a-developer's-toolbox?"><a href="#a-developer's-toolbox?">A Developer's Toolbox?</a></h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/toolbox3.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/toolbox3-262x300.jpg" alt="Developer&#039;s Toolbox" width="262" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-23710" /></a></p>
<p>The role of a developer has changed quite a bit since I graduated with a Software Engineering degree in 2001. Up until I joined Pusher my role was primarily a Software Engineer attempting to follow what the industry defined as "best practice"; first documentation through to development (the waterfall model), then an increased focus on testing, which continued with the introduction of agile in the form of Extreme Programming (XP), SCRUM, Kanban etc.</p>
<p>The reason that things changed when I joined Pusher wasn't because the development team don't follow those best practices (or their own incarnation of them) - they do. It's because I <strong>started to attend hackathons</strong> where the focus is creating something functional - ideally with a <strong>wow factor</strong> - within a short space of time.</p>
<p>The teams that tend to win such events aren't necessarily the best software engineers, but are those that have a <strong>developer toolbox</strong> that they can look through when they are trying to solve a problem.</p>
<p>A knowledge of a programming language isn't simply an understanding of syntax and structure; it also covers a knowledge of the libraries and extensions that are available as part of the technology runtime. A developer toolbox goes beyond an understanding of a development runtime. It extends to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Productivity tools</strong>: Development environments (editors, IDEs, OS tooling, testing, profiling, debugging and hardware)</li>
<li><strong>Application runtimes and frameworks</strong>: for web development where you <em>probably</em> (see point 4) need a web server and a database this is important. Your developer toolbox should contain these already setup up and ready to go. Or provide ways of quickly doing so.</li>
<li><strong>3rd party libraries</strong>: if a problem has already been solved by a library then use it</li>
<li><strong>A knowledge of APIs and hosted services</strong>: By knowing what APIs and hosted services are available you can quickly uses these tools to achieve things that would otherwise take you hours to weeks to achieve.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hosted services - which offer APIs - actually combine productivity tools, application runtimes &amp; frameworks and the functionality offered by 3rd party libraries. This makes them amazingly powerful and, I'd argue, are becoming the most important tools in a developer toolbox.</p>
<h3 id="my-developer-toolbox---how-the-realtime-collaborative-mapping-app-was-built"><a href="#my-developer-toolbox---how-the-realtime-collaborative-mapping-app-was-built">My Developer Toolbox - How the Realtime Collaborative Mapping app was built</a></h3>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/realtime-global-collaboration1.jpg" alt="Realtime Global Collaboration" width="1000" height="714" class="alignright size-full wp-image-23709" /></p>
<p>For the Realtime Collaborative Mapping application I used the following tools from my developer toolbox:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/">ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a> - obviously.</li>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> as a JavaScript web application framework. I used it for routing and data binding.</li>
<li><a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a> for realtime synchronisation of data (graphics) between users.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Why didn't I use <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>? Since I work for Pusher I use the Pusher API all the time. I saw this as an opportunity to use another API that I knew about but hadn't had a chance to really dig into. I also saw the application I was building as needing realtime data synchronisation with persistence which we (Pusher) don't presently offer - our focus is realtime messaging with integration into existing web stacks. This would have been achievable with Pusher but I would have needed a few more lines of JavaScript code to do so.</em></p>
<p>I chose these tools because the application was to be built using front-end web technologies with a heavy focus on JavaScript.</p>
<h4 id="arcgis-api-for-javascript"><a href="#arcgis-api-for-javascript">ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a></h4>
<p>My usage of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript was really simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L46">Create a map</a> using a webmap ID</li>
<li>Add a <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L56">drawing toolbar</a> to the map</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L69">Add a graphic</a> too the map when the user draws one and <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L81">remove a graphic</a> when required too</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="angular-js"><a href="#angular-js">Angular JS</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L6">routing part</a> was really simple. I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>a landing page where users could enter an existing webmap ID, or choose from some pre-selected ones.</li>
<li>a map view which would have the webmap ID in the URL for easy sharing, show the selected webmap and let a user draw graphics on the map</li>
</ul>
<p>Angular JS also provides a mechanism for exposing properties which offer two-way data binding. I used this to expose:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L21">share URL</a></li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L22">encoded version</a> of the share URL</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L31">type of drawing</a> that the user had selected in the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/views/map.html#L2-L39">toolbar view</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="firebase"><a href="#firebase">Firebase</a></h4>
<p>My use of Firebase goes to show just how easy it is to add realtime functionality to web applications using a realtime web hosted service. I used Firebase to persist and share the graphics data between all users who were viewing the same map.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L74">Connect to Firebase</a> and identify where the data for my app is to be stored within my "collaborative mapping" Firebase app. I appended a webmap ID so that all data associated with a given map would be shared. I could have appended another unique ID so that groups could share privately</li>
<li>I bound to <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L75-L78"><code>child_added</code> and <code>child_removed</code> events</a> so the app knew when a new graphic had been added or an existing one removed</li>
<li>I used Firebase as a model for the graphics on my map. What this meant is whenever a new graphic was added I simply <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L58">added it to Firebase</a> and the added code was called. The really clever bit is that the code was not only called within the app of the user who added the graphic but <strong>also within the app for all other users who were view the same map</strong>.</li>
<li>When a user clicked the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/views/map.html#L36">Clear All button</a> I prompted the user for confirmation and then <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/master/realtime-collaborative-mapping/js/ArcGIS.js#L58">removed the webmap node</a> from Firebase. In a real app I'd use <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/security-quickstart.html">Firebase security</a> to restrict who was allowed to execute such a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've supplied quite a bit of detail here. But this all actually only equates to the code using the Firebase object 5 times. Wow! <strong>5 lines of code to convert a web application into a realtime collaborative web app</strong> - realtime web technology really is powerful!</p>
<h3 id="what-has-been-achieved?"><a href="#what-has-been-achieved?">What has been achieved?</a></h3>
<p>Ok, I've won the competition - which is awesome! Thanks, ESRI. What I'm also hoping has been achieved is that by creating the application and writing this is blog post I've demonstrated:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>power of realtime web technologies</strong> - with <em>5 lines of code</em> I've made an application support multiple simultaneous users and collaborative. This means that anybody in the world with a web browser and an Internet connection can collaborate on a map with anybody else.</li>
<li>How <strong>using a hosted service + API to add amazing functionality in fraction of the time</strong> and effort it would take to write this all myself.</li>
<li>The importance of a having a well equipped <strong>Developer Toolbox</strong> - I hope this has got you thinking about what's in your Developer Toolbox. I'm sure the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit">ESRI DevSummit</a> has given you more tools to add to your toolbox arsenal, and it's important that you continue to improve what's in there by attending events, reading up on technology and trying things yourself (maybe at hackdays).</li>
<li>Finally - something I'm really excited about - is how it's now easier than ever to use a <strong>fusion of technologies to create very powerful applications on the web</strong>. The Google Maps API launched in 2005 (whilst I was at ESRI) and if the ArcGIS API for JavaScript had been about who knows what I'd be doing now. I'm not a GIS developer, but I understand the power of GIS so I can't wait to see GIS appear in more applications. See <a href="http://tweetmap.it/">TweetMap</a> and <a href="http://rawkes.com/articles/vizicities-dev-diary-1">ViziCities</a> as some exciting examples.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="where-next?"><a href="#where-next?">Where next?</a></h3>
<p>I'd really like some feedback on the application. I'd also like people to <a href="https://github.com/Esri/100-lines-or-less-js">fork the application</a> and go beyond the 100 lines of JavaScript (it is a bit messy) and change it into a real application - <strong>it does have real potential</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" align="center"><p>Congratulations to Phil Leggetter, winner of the ArcGIS JavaScript code challenge!<a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23devsummit">#devsummit</a>. <a href="http://t.co/VIiTXfJE1Q" title="http://po.st/BcnnTp">po.st/BcnnTp</a></p>

<p><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I also need to look into how I'm going to get to Palm Springs for the ESRI International Developer Summit in 2014. <strong>Maybe I could propose a talk about how I built the Realtime Collaborative Mapping application and get some costs covered?</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully I'll see you at the ESRI Developer Summit in 2014!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For a long while now I've not been getting as much out of Twitter as I used to. There's too much information to take in.</p>
<p>I've long said that Twitter is throw-away. If you miss something then it doesn't matter. If it's important then I'll see a retweet or pick up the information from somewhere else. <strong>This is wrong</strong>. Just because it's not being retweeted by everybody it doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile update. Just because it doesn't get upvoted on Hacker News it doesn't mean that it's not relevant to me.</p>
<p>Somethings is wrong with how I use Twitter. I know I'm not getting as much value from it as I should. It's still a great source of information when asking questions. But I want to be able to listen, reply and having better conversations.</p>
<p>I follow(ed) 940 Twitter users. That's too many. <strong>So, I've unfollowed everyone!</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to start from scratch. I'm going to follow those that I've had conversations with recently. I'm going to re-follow those that I know I've read tweets from recently and gained value from. I'm going to start following others who I have conversations with or discover again.</p>
<h3 id="reclaimed-with-a-hack"><a href="#reclaimed-with-a-hack">Reclaimed with a hack</a></h3>
<p>I obviously didn't want to have to do this manually. That would probably have taken a while. I had a quick search for apps to let me unfollow everybody but most apps appear to offer a limited number of unfollows and then require some sort of upgrade. So, I've hacked something together that I can use in future and may be useful to others. It's now in a <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/reclaim-social">Reclaim Social github repo</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm on the "What Developers Want" panel at the <a href="http://apiconference.com/about-2012/london-2012/">Business of APIs Conference London</a>, arranged by <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>. I'm also giving a lightening talk on my take on "What Developers Want".</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="302" src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/26755655/highlight/310780?v=3&amp;wmode=direct" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px none transparent;">    </iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/" style="padding: 2px 0px 4px; width: 400px; background: #ffffff; display: block; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px; text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;" target="_blank">Video streaming by Ustream</a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly I believe they wany the APIs to offer access to their data in Realtime. Here are the details:</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-an-api-awesome?"><a href="#what-makes-an-api-awesome?">What Makes An API Awesome?</a></h2>
<p>We now have a better idea than ever before what is required to offer an awesome API.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong>developer portals</strong> speak to developers, making it clear what our API offers and how it can benefit them.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> is well structured, easy to understand and full of lovely code examples</li>
<li>Our API follow <strong>best practices</strong> to ensure they can be easily understood, consumed and to building confidence in our solution.</li>
<li>We offer well maintained <strong>API libraries</strong> to further speed up the integration of the API using our favourite technologies, to make commonly executed tasks even easier to perform and hide away complexity of some of the more advanced ones.</li>
<li>We have amazing <strong>tooling</strong> that not only lets us test how we interact with an API and the responses we get (e.g. <a href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">io docs</a>) but also provides us with detailed information about how the API interpreted the interaction and exposing the inner workings of our service in relation to the developers functionality</li>
<li>We are <strong>building communities</strong> of <strong>heroes</strong> who champion our product</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-more-can-we-offer?"><a href="#what-more-can-we-offer?">What more can we offer?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Realtime!</strong> Let me explain:</p>
<p>Developers have to make lots of calls to our APIs; make queries to retrieve data, to see if data has changed, to see if new data is available. Take a query as an example: do you have any new information for me?... do you have any new information for me? How about now? Now?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if the instant your API had new or updated information that it was pushed to the developer? You developer has already expressed an interest in data from you by calling your API.</p>
<p>Start thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>A query to your API isn't always just a one off search or transction. Does is really represent a <strong>subscription for data</strong>? If so, offer a way of making that call a subscription.</li>
<li>When <strong>new data</strong> is created that matches a query push it to them.</li>
<li>When data that a developer has retrieved <strong>changes</strong> within your system, push it to them.</li>
<li>Better yet, give them a way of using that technology directly within their client applications so <strong>push data directly to the users of their applications</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>How much effort would this save the developer? How much value would this add to your API? How cool would this be for the developer?</p>
<p>So, how can you push this information to your developers?</p>
<h2 id="realtime-web-technologies"><a href="#realtime-web-technologies">Realtime Web Technologies</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-pubsub-paradigm"><a href="#the-pubsub-paradigm">The PubSub Paradigm</a></h3>
<p>In order to push information to developers you need to know that they are interested in that data. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">Publish Subscriber pattern</a> makes this possible.</p>
<h3 id="webhooks"><a href="#webhooks">WebHooks</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">WebHooks</a> offer a way of instantly pushing information from one server to another via a simple HTTP call. Since you have a list of subscribers when you receive new information that matches a subscription or information that a developer is insterested in updates you can push it to a URL. Simple!</p>
<h3 id="http-streaming"><a href="#http-streaming">HTTP Streaming</a></h3>
<p>HTTP Streaming offers a way of holding a HTTP connection open so that your API can instantly push new information over that existing connection. This is probably an option if your data updates quite frequently.</p>
<h3 id="websockets"><a href="#websockets">WebSockets</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets">WebSockets</a> offer a way of maintaining a connection between a server and a client. This lets you instantly push information from the server to the client, but also lets the two instantly communicate in general. WebSockets are an amazing opportunity to API providers for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can instantly deliver information to any applicaiton that is connected to the web; web apps, mobile apps, networked robots.</li>
<li>From the point of view from a developer this means they don't need any infrastructure to deal with the delivery of this realtime data. You are providing that for them. This infrastructure can be very real benefit to the developer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="realtime-apis---i-want-proof"><a href="#realtime-apis---i-want-proof">Realtime APIs - I Want Proof</a></h2>
<p>Here are just a few of the many companies who are successfully using Realtime Web Technologies as a core part of their API.</p>
<h3 id="pusher"><a href="#pusher">Pusher</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> is a hosted WebSockets API so we're delivering this benefit to our customers every day. It's also possible to potentially use Pusher as your WebSockets API. Just a thought!</p>
<h3 id="twilio"><a href="#twilio">Twilio</a></h3>
<p>Twilio use WebHooks to let the developer know when an SMS is recieved on a phone number or when there is an incoming call. They also use WebSockets in the Twilio client.</p>
<h3 id="sendgrid"><a href="#sendgrid">SendGrid</a></h3>
<p>SendGrid use WebHooks as part of their <a href="http://sendgrid.com/docs/API%20Reference/Webhooks/event.html">Event</a> &amp; <a href="http://sendgrid.com/docs/API%20Reference/Webhooks/parse.html">Parse</a> functionality.</p>
<h3 id="datasift"><a href="#datasift">DataSift</a></h3>
<p>DataSift offer a HTTP Streaming API so that they can instantly deliver new interactions which meet the criteria you've defined in your DataSift streams.</p>
<h3 id="mailchimp"><a href="#mailchimp">MailChimp</a></h3>
<p>MailChimp offer <a href="http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/webhooks/">WebHooks</a> for a number of events within their system including new subscriptions, unsubscribes, profile changes, email address changes and more.</p>
<h3 id="twitter"><a href="#twitter">Twitter</a></h3>
<p>Twitter have a number of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">HTTP Streaming API endpoints</a> so that the developer is instantly informed whenever a new tweet is found.</p>
<p><strong>And many more…</strong></p>
<h2 id="realtime-=-more-awesome"><a href="#realtime-=-more-awesome">Realtime = More Awesome</a></h2>
<p>The technology to let you offer these improved <strong>Developer Experiences</strong> exist in the form of Realtime Web Technologies. So, start thinking about how you can use them to make things easier for them and take that next step in making your API even more awesome.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/10/25/talking-realtime-web-at-twiliocon.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/thumb/twiliocon-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 20px;" align="center" /></p>
<p>A couple of days after the <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2012/10/22/a-realtime-focus-at-html5devconf">WebSockets panel at HTML5DevConf</a> in San Francisco I gave a talk at <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2012/10/22/a-realtime-focus-at-html5devconf">TwilioCon</a>. We were asked to try and cover a <em>big</em> topic and focus on a few key points. Since the conference was for Twilio, a telephony cloud service, we wanted to cover something that both incorporated Twilio and realtime web technologies such as Pusher. The topic we therefore decided to cover was <strong>How the Realtime Web is Influencing the Future of Communications</strong>. The themes that the talk would cover was:</p>
<h4 id="the-evolution-of-communication"><a href="#the-evolution-of-communication">The evolution of communication</a></h4>
<p>How communication has evolved, the different forms of communication, the role that the Internet and realtime web technologies already play and how they will be the focus of how we communicate in the future. The Web is now <strong>the</strong> communications platform.</p>
<h4 id="the-potential-to-reach-large-audiences"><a href="#the-potential-to-reach-large-audiences">The potential to reach large audiences</a></h4>
<p>The Web and Realtime web technologies make it possible to have instant interactive conversations over large distances and offer the potential to reach massive audiences.</p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-cloud-services"><a href="#the-role-of-cloud-services">The role of cloud services</a></h4>
<p>Cloud services make it possible to bridge the gap between the telephony and Internet networks, offer access to amazing infrastructure and make it possible to add functionality to our applications that would otherwise be out of reach, or take a very long time to build and manage.</p>
<h4 id="time-to-innovate"><a href="#time-to-innovate">Time to innovate</a></h4>
<p>We are now at a point where we have the infrastructure and tools to allow us (software developers) to truly innovate.</p>
<h3 id="future-echos&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;"><a href="#future-echos&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;">Future Echos<sup>*</sup></a></h3>
<p>Little did we know, but some of these key themes would be touched upon in the keynotes of both <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff Lawson</a>, Twilio's CEO &amp; Co-founder, and Twilio's CTO &amp; Co-Founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/emcooke">Evan Cooke</a>.</p>
<p>Jeff's focus was on <strong>Software People</strong>. He told the attendees how Twilio was built by Software People for Software People. Although they had been advised by some to build a consumer-focused product and then, later, expose their API. Instead Twilio focused on building amazing infrastructure and functionality with a focus on exposing it through a simple, but powerful, API. This has resulted in innovation using the Twilio service that the founders couldn't have imagined. Jeff future echoed one of the key points I would address in my talk; how cloud services have allowed us to reach the point that give software developers the power to truly innovate.</p>
<p>Evan's keynote covered how communications have evolved, again future echoing my talk (I honestly didn't know he was going to cover this - his slides were much more professional though :) ). He then focused on the importance, details and effort that has gone into Twilio's infrastructure. Again, how a cloud service, providing solid infrastructure, means that developers can use the service with confidence leaving them free to innovate.</p>
<p><small style="font-size: smaller;"><sup>*</sup> <a href="http://uktv.co.uk/dave/series/tvseries/258942">Red Dwarf X</a> has started in the UK and I couldn't resist the opportunity to make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Echoes">this reference</a></small></p>
<h3 id="realtime-web-talk"><a href="#realtime-web-talk">Realtime Web Talk</a></h3>
<p>Here are the slides from my <strong>How the Realtime Web is Influencing the Future of Communications</strong> talk at TwilioCon.</p>
<p>

<h3 id="it-is-time-to-innovate"><a href="#it-is-time-to-innovate">It is time to innovate</a></h3>
<p>We really are at a point where we have an amazing set of tools at our disposal that give us the opportunity to innovate and build awesome things. These can be software applications, services or physical devices which bridge digital and physical. All of these can be glued together with software which harness the power of the web through APIs and cloud services. Because Realtime Web technologies are now absolutely core to how we communicate we believe that <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> is going to be a big part of this push for innovation.</p>
<p>*If this makes you want to innovate then look out for us at hack events - <a href="http://twitter.com/rich_caudle">Rich Caudle</a> will be at <a href="http://hackmanchester">Hack Manchester</a> this weekend. Here's <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2012/10/22/hackmanchester">a taster</a> of the sorts of things you can achieve with Pusher.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/10/24/html5devconf-oct-2012-notes-from-the-websocket-panel.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/10/24/html5devconf-oct-2012-notes-from-the-websocket-panel.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On October 16th 2012 I sat on a <a href="http://html5devconf">HTML5DevConf</a> WebSocket panel along with <a href="http://www.igvita.com/">Ilya Grigorik</a> from Google, <a href="https://twitter.com/debergalis">Matt DeBergalis</a> from Meteor and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pmoskovi">Peter Moskovits</a> from Kaazing - the panel was chaired by <a href="https://twitter.com/frankgreco">Frank Greco</a>, also of Kaazing.</p>

<p>Here are the notes, in a pretty raw format, from the event. A more curated write-up can be found on the <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2012/10/22/a-realtime-focus-at-html5devconf">Pusher blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-ws-affect-current-web-infrastructure-the-most?"><a href="#where-does-ws-affect-current-web-infrastructure-the-most?">Where does WS affect current web infrastructure the most?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The potential for many more persistent connection to be held open.</li>
<li>As apps move away from polling this is a good things as it probably works out as less resource usage.</li>
<li>But as we see WebSockets used more and more we'll see more peristent connections. I'm not sure what the overall result would be of this.</li>
<li>Some parts of the Web infrastructure are playing catch-up:
<ul>
<li>Some proxies are troublesome. Whilst the majority of WebSocket connections get through over WSS/SSL on port 443 there are some cases where they don't.</li>
<li>Not really web infrastructure as such, but some anti-virus packages that offer "web shields" are blocking WebSockets. We're waiting on companies like Avast! to catch up. It's impacting user experiences and productivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-use-ws-when-http2.0/spdy-is-soon-pervasive?"><a href="#why-use-ws-when-http2.0/spdy-is-soon-pervasive?">Why use WS when HTTP2.0/SPDY is soon pervasive?</a></h2>
<p>HTML5 represents a move to empower developers with the tools required to build rich interactive applications in the web browser. HTML5 WebSockets are a core element in enabling that interactive functionality. For me, WebSockets are a tool for developers - they're an API. SPDY is a protocol for the web browser to improve the efficiency of web content distribution.</p>
<h2 id="what's-the-real-advantage-of-ws-to-web-servers-(and-app-servers)?"><a href="#what's-the-real-advantage-of-ws-to-web-servers-(and-app-servers)?">What's the real advantage of WS to web servers (and app servers)?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bi-direction communication is they key benefit; instant interaction between client and server.</li>
<li>For apps that have been 'faking' realtime bi-directional functionality using Comet they can now do this in a standardised, and more efficient, way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-new-types-of-applications-does-ws-unlock?"><a href="#what-new-types-of-applications-does-ws-unlock?">What new types of applications does WS unlock?</a></h2>
<p>It makes applications that we've previously been hacking more easily achievable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant notifications of activity about things we are interested in. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PUSH NOTIFICATIONS. These notifications can then be used to kick-off more interactive experiences. That's where WebSockets really stand out.</li>
<li>Live content
<ul>
<li>Stats</li>
<li>Live blogging</li>
<li>Realtime news</li>
<li>Realtime social feeds/activity streams</li>
<li>But these can be achieved using EventSource/SSE</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interactive experiences
<ul>
<li>Realtime communication with colleagues and customers</li>
<li>Collaborative applications like Google docs - you don't need Google's infrastructure to build this sort of things now. It doesn't have to be text - there's a real opportunity to hook into some of the amazing features in HTML5 and build dynamic collaborative experiences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because WebSockets is a standard it's not restricted to web browsers - I'm starting to see a lot more cross device interaction; one to one and one to many.
<ul>
<li>We're seeing quite a few Arduino applications built which is a great sign that we are moving towards the Internet of Things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you merge all this together - live content from different sources, interactive functionality between users, systems and devices, there's really very little limit to what can be achieved other than our imagination. This is why I think Creative Technologists are having a lot of fun with this technology - they are pushing the boundaries.</li>
<li>In terms of application types in browsers - WebSockets most definitely fit the move to Single Page Applications (SPAs).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="doesn't-ws-present-new-types-of-security-issues?"><a href="#doesn't-ws-present-new-types-of-security-issues?">Doesn't WS present new types of security issues?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The protocol deals with security considerations. It's then up to the runtime to ensure that an application doesn't do anything naughty - that's no different from any other technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-isn't-ws-just-a-slightly-better-comet?"><a href="#why-isn't-ws-just-a-slightly-better-comet?">Why isn't WS just a slightly better Comet?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>WebSockets are a technology answering the need for realtime bi-directional communication that was previously answered by Comet solutions - there's no escaping that. But a lot of the HTML5 features are things that let us achieve things we were previously having to jump through hoops to achieve.</li>
<li>It's standardised so the functionality works the same way cross browser</li>
<li>It's not restricted to browsers (nor was Comet) so it means we have a standardised way of achieveing realtime bi-directional communication on the web.</li>
<li>WebSockets work over a single connection so it's much more efficient that comet solutions which required two connections for bi-directional communication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-ws-important-for-cloud-services-and-apps?"><a href="#why-is-ws-important-for-cloud-services-and-apps?">Why is WS important for cloud services and apps?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The fundamental reason why WebSockets are important is they are a core component in a move to make the web an interactive communication platform. HTML5 gives us a set of tools that let developers build much richer experiences than we could previously but without a realtime interactive aspect we would just be creating static RIAs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-are-we-going-next?"><a href="#where-are-we-going-next?">Where are we going next?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>WebSockets are not just a browser technology. As I said before, I believe they are a key component for realtime communication on the Web between any client and any server. The Web is now a communication platform and realtime is a massive part of that. There are so many areas where realtime communcation saves time, money, increases user experiences, improves engagment and offers great opportunity that we've only just scatched the surface of the possibilities.</li>
</ul>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/09/14/b2b-services-everybody-is-a-potential-customer.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/09/14/b2b-services-everybody-is-a-potential-customer.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's too broad a statement to say that absolutely everybody is your customer. But, you actually never know if the next person you speak to could be a potential customer so you should treat them that way. Treat them the way you would want to be treated no matter the roles you are currently in. Let me explain.</p>

<h2 id="the-thank-you-economy"><a href="#the-thank-you-economy">The Thank You Economy</a></h2>
<p>I'm recently back from a holiday and during that time I picked up the Thank You Ecomony by Gary Vaynerchuk again - I'd read a number of chapters but never got around to completing it. The <a href="http://thankyoueconomybook.com/">Thank You Economy website</a> provides an overview of the idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world of business is coming full circle. The rise of the Internet and the empowerment of the common consumer has created a fundamental shift in how businesses are expected to behave.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this opportunity, businesses will need to look backwards and scale the caring their grandparents' businesses exhibited towards their customers or watch their competition pass them by.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally it means give a crap about your customers and build relationships with them. A real relationship will result in real loyalty and thanks to social networks the word will spread about you and your business. There's also an emphasis about ensuring you focus on long-term rather than short-term wins as customers will see through this. The relationships have to be genuine to really work.</p>
<h2 id="customer-service"><a href="#customer-service">Customer Service</a></h2>
<p>The Thank You Economy focus is customer service and this is something I <em>feel</em> very strongly about.</p>
<p>When I'm trying to help somebody I really do care about the service I provide - sometimes to my own detriment. So, if they're not happy with the service I've provided it affects me. The problem is that sometimes you just can't win. It might be that somebody is just looking for conflict. It might be that the situation is at a point where you can't be your normal friendly way, nothing you can do is good enough and you just need to tread carefully and not take things personally.</p>
<p>In these difficult situations you are in the role of the B2B customer service representative and you are providing a service to a customer. But what if that customer also has a B2B service, or one day works for one? There's a chance that your roles may reverse and they might be trying to sell you a service or even providing you customer service. Even if that's not they case they still represent the company that they own or work for. The way they are acting reflects on their company.</p>
<h2 id="treat-everybody-as-a-potential-customer"><a href="#treat-everybody-as-a-potential-customer">Treat everybody as a potential customer</a></h2>
<p>The point really is to treat everybody with respect and the way that you would like to be treated. It might be that in one particular conversation you are the customer and they are the customer services representative. You, as the customer, might feel that you've been unfairly treated and you might want to take it out on somebody.</p>
<p><strong>Don't!</strong></p>
<p>They work for a business and although in the present conversation you are the customer and they are the service provider you should still think of them as a customer. If you handle the situation correctly, and treat them as you would like to be treated, they may well be a customer some day. If you are difficult and unfair then it may mean that they will be highly unlikely to use any service that you are part of.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/thumb/geeks.png" alt="Geeks" align="right" /></p>
<p>I can't believe it! I left University to take my first job 11 years ago. During that time I've worked in finance, e-learning, GIS and SEO/digital marketing. Although I've had some interest in these sectors my real interest was just the technology, with a passion for realtime web technologies. I now work for Pusher and can focus almost entirely on realtime web technologies and the application of them. Whilst I'm truly lucky to be able to work day-in day-out on something I'm passionate about, it's always a good idea to gain exposure to new things. New experiences exercise the mind and you never know when those experiences will help with what you normally do.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2012/5/3/shakey-has-it-all-realtime-mobile-browser-and-user-audience-engagement">attending Culture Hack Scotland</a> my eyes were opened to a new experience; the focus was still technology, but used in innovate and experimental ways with a focus on 'culture'.</p>
<h2 id="uncultured-me"><a href="#uncultured-me">Uncultured Me</a></h2>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the most 'cultured' of individuals. I don't tend to go to musical or theatrical events, art galleries or museums - unless it's to see Dinosaur skeletons; my wife would undoubtedly mention the fact that about 100 of the 150 photos we took whilst in New York a few years ago are of dino bones. I've been to the Tate Modern once and all I can remember from the trip was an upside-down piano and a video of some guy hitting himself where it hurts whilst wearing boxing gloves. I really like going to the cinema, but I only tend to go to watch comedies or blockbusters.</p>
<p>So, how and why have I ended up as a <a href="http://www.welcometosync.com/geeks/">Geek-in-Residence</a> for Sync, "a two year prototyping and innovation programme for the cultural sector in Scotland."?</p>
<h2 id="exercise-the-mind"><a href="#exercise-the-mind">Exercise the mind</a></h2>
<p>As I said in the introduction, new experiences exercise the mind. But, I'm also aware that my lack of culture isn't actually something to boast about. It's something I want to change and I felt the Geeks-in-Residence programme represented a perfect opportunity for me to use my existing development skills and at the same time give me some exposure to areas that I generally wouldn't be otherwise.</p>
<p>I applied to for a position as geek on the <a href="http://macrobert.org">MacRobert</a> project, a project with an initial focus on engaging with students before, during and after events. There were a few reasons why this project was of interest to me.</p>
<ol>
<li>MacRoberts is an Art centre. What better place to get cultured.</li>
<li>I believe that realtime web technologies will play a massive part in the future of the web. They allow interactive and engaging applications to be built and this matched well with the project outline.</li>
<li>I went to the University of Stirling. Although MacRobert is it's own entity it is still in the heart of the university so I'm hopeful that I can do something to have a positive impact on the university. Back to where I was 11 years ago!</li>
<li>I live very near to Stirling University. It's just handy/ideal!</li>
</ol>
<p>I put something like this on my application form. It must have worked...</p>
<h2 id="i-got-in!"><a href="#i-got-in!">I got in!</a></h2>
<p>A bit like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQj_tcQ2Ey8">Kevin Flynn entering the grid</a>, I was very excited that, after an interview with <a href="http://twitter.com/beyongolia">Erin Mcguire</a>, I was asked to take on a Geek-in-Residence on the MacRobert project.</p>
<p>I was also really excited to hear that I'd be working with <a href="http://andyyoungdesign.wordpress.com/">Andy Young</a> of <a href="http://wearesnook.com/snook/">Snook</a>. Andy is a products and services designer so I'm undoubtedly going to learn a bunch of stuff from him. Well, I already have, but I'll save that for another post.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Bring Back Beckham 2 - A #HackLDN experiment]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/07/16/bring-back-beckham-2-a-hackldn-experiment.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/07/16/bring-back-beckham-2-a-hackldn-experiment.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/120q37130m2k382p3b2G/bbb-redux.png" width="200" align="right" style="margin: 20px;" alt="Bring Back Beckham banner" /></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended <a href="http://hackathonlondon.com/">HackLDN</a> for the 2nd time. The focus of the event is very much to create something with real business potential. I completely understand the reasoning behind that and back the idea. But, if everybody had an idea and everybody wanted to work on their own project, to create a company, then there would be a lot of one-man/woman teams. We need people to go along to have fun and experiment with technologies. These types of people are as important as the 'entrepreneurs'. I decided to <a href="/2012/06/29/hackldn-idea-bring-back-beckham.html">pitch Bring Back Beckham (redux)</a> as a fun experiment - not a startup idea. And low and behold I ended up with a team.</p>
<p>You can read and watch <a href="/2012/06/29/hackldn-idea-bring-back-beckham.html">the pitch</a> if you want to find out some more about the idea. This post is more to thank the guys I worked with and provide a bit of information about what we came up with.</p>
<h2 id="the-team"><a href="#the-team">The Team</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/553838_10151068133476154_921499766_n.jpeg" alt="Bring Back Beckham team" /></p>
<p>The Bring Back Beckham team consisted of a bunch of guys who would class themselves as being more ideas people than programmers - and me (not sure what I class myself as ;)). But, unlike a lot of entrepreneurs these guys <strong>want</strong> to write code - they want to be able to prototype an idea. For me, that's really important and great to see.</p>

<p>After a couple of frustrating attempts in trying to prototype web development ideas by first finding a CTO, I reached the conclusion that the best way forward is by learning coding. Having taught myself programming for the past 6 months, I came to #HackLDN to improve my web development skills. I can safely conclude that #BringBackBeckham had been an awesome project to work on and definitely made me a much better developer.</p>

<p>Having recently graduated from University I've a number of business projects I'd like to set in motion. A relative novice at web design and programming I came to the Hack London event in order to meet other like minded individuals and to improve my programming skills. I got all this and more; including free Dominos, KFC, copious red bull, unabashed Pusher plugs by the hour and deeper understanding of the hacker communities sleeping habits</p>

I have enjoyed making this site at the Hack London event and furthered my skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-app"><a href="#the-app">The App</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of Bring Back Beckham 2 (redux - whatever!) was to try and create an instant impact, high traction application - and potentially a framework. Something that would be a central location on the Internet for all things related to Beckham's exclusion from Team GB.</p>
<h3 id="features"><a href="#features">Features</a></h3>
<p>Our features list included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Yes/No vote about whether Beckham should be included and if Pearce had made the correct decision.</li>
<li>The ability to provide a comment along with the vote.</li>
<li>Instantly display other votes and comments using Pusher to keep users on the site.</li>
<li>Turn the comments into a conversation using replies.</li>
<li>Vote up/down comments</li>
<li>Include news from other sources - to ensure the site was the central focused destination for all things Beckham and Team GB related.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tech"><a href="#tech">Tech</a></h3>
<p>We decided to write the new Bring Back Beckham in <strong>PHP</strong> (WAMP/MAMP/LAMP) - not because anybody actually had PHP skills - more because it's probably one of the easiest languages to get started with<sup>†</sup> and there wasn't another language that the team were all familiar with.</p>
<p><small><sup>†</sup><em>Would anybody argue differently?</em></small></p>
<p>Of course we'd use <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> for the realtime voting and interactive parts of the application; vote up/down, replies, comments, vote % updates.</p>
<p>So, after a bit of work setting up runtime environments we all got to coding. PHP/MySQL with <a href="http://mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> and <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">xampp</a> does make it really easy to get started no matter your development machine. Can the same be said for Ruby on Rails or node.js? I'll need to dig into this.</p>
<p>Use source control from the off - no matter the level of experience in your team. We initially tried to use Dropbox to share our code. We soon found that this wasn't a good idea. I'd been a bit worried about using source control as thought it would mean spending lots of time dealing with that rather than coding. I was completely wrong. We used <a href="http://github.com">github</a> and even though there were moments that slowed us down, e.g. the first time somebody came across a merge conflict, it really sped up the development process. Checkout <a href="http://try.github.com">try.github.com</a>.</p>
<p>Another decision I made, again because I assumed it would make things harder for the team, was not to use an application framework. I now can't help but wonder if we should have tried to use something <a href="http://fuelphp.com/">FuelPHP</a> from the off.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-achieved-and-learned"><a href="#what-we-achieved-and-learned">What we achieved and learned</a></h2>
<p>The site is live at <a href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com">http://www.bringbackbeckham.com</a>. We have a voting system along with comments. We also have realtime updates when new comments come in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com"><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/120q37130m2k382p3b2G/bbb-redux.png" width="500" /></a></p>
<h3 id="we-could-have-achieved-more"><a href="#we-could-have-achieved-more">We could have achieved more</a></h3>
<p>I feel responsible for us not delivering more. I under-estimated the ability for the team to pick up best practices. The things we did do like project management using a Kanban-like process and source control using github were real successes.</p>
<h3 id="gaining-traction-takes-time"><a href="#gaining-traction-takes-time">Gaining traction takes time</a></h3>
<p>On the Sunday morning we launched and did start to get a bit of traction through Facebook and Twitter along. But, to really obtain traction you need to put in a lot of effort, look for posts to comment on, engage in conversations on Twitter, be willing and able to argue the point - all of this takes time. We ran out of it.</p>
<h3 id="understand-your-cause"><a href="#understand-your-cause">Understand your cause</a></h3>
<p>People will quickly see if you know the subject or are just doing something for commercial or spammy reasons. So, it's essential that the people manning your social media channels are knowledgable and passionate about the subject.</p>
<h3 id="emails-go-stale-:)"><a href="#emails-go-stale-:)">Emails go stale :)</a></h3>
<p>We did have 6,000 emails from the last Bring Back Beckham campaign. But we soon learned that emails go stale and Mailchimp quickly suspended our account due to a high bounce-rate. They've since enabled it again.</p>
<h3 id="marketing-is-as-important-as-the-tech"><a href="#marketing-is-as-important-as-the-tech">Marketing is as important as the tech</a></h3>
<p>It's no doubt the same with other technologies and ideas; you can have the best product in the world but it's useless if nobody knows about it.</p>
<h3 id="fun-achieved"><a href="#fun-achieved">Fun achieved</a></h3>
<p>I also felt we had real moments of excitement during the project. This brought back some of the excitement I had from the original project which was one of the main reasons I wanted to try this project again.</p>
<h3 id="framework"><a href="#framework">Framework</a></h3>
<p>We do actually have a partial framework in place. If you look at the site you can see that it would be very easily to change the site to focus on a different campaign. What it is missing is anything that make the site a go-to source; it needs news curated from external sources. We also didn't add vote up/down and 'reply to comment' features which would have made the site much more interactive. But, I'm hopeful that we'll work on this in the background and eventually have a framework which we can use again should the opportunity arise.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-to-the-team"><a href="#thanks-to-the-team">Thanks to the team</a></h2>
<p>Finally, a big thanks to Bobby, John and Rich. It was really great to work with you all and I look forward to diving in and out of the project over the coming months to continue the learning experience - and you never know, there might be another opportunity to use what we've built in the future!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://bringbackbeckham.com/img/bringbackbeckham_vote_150x144.jpg" align="right" title="Bring Back Beckham" /><br />
I'm attending <a href="http://hackathonlondon.com/">Hackathon London</a> this weekend. Normally I help each team at the event but don't get too involved in individual projects. This time things might be different.</p>
<p>In 2006 David Beckham was dropped from the England squad by Steve McClaren. This wasn't a footballing decision, it was to try and stamp his authority on the team and show he was his own man. It massively backfired.</p>

<p>I saw this an an opportunity and created <strong>Bring Back Beckham</strong>. I created the site in a night and after 4 days it had received over 30,000 hits and over 10,000 people had voted for Beckham's inclusion in the England squad. The site had radio and newspaper media coverage and much more - you can read more about it <a href="/2007/03/09/bring-back-beckham.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, 6 years later David Beckham is again dividing opinion. This time he has been left out of the Team GB football squad for the 2012 Olympics. This is another big opportunity to create an application to gather comment and opinion on this massively hot topic. Here's my pitch - which I did at 5am this morning.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ThJhV9CZAhs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you are interested in building a realtime web application using HTML5 technologies, and trying to achieve similar success over a weekend (lots of buzz and let's aim for 10,000 hits) then this will most definitely be a fun project to get involved with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a></strong> - for realtime interaction, comments and voting</li>
<li><strong>Responsive design</strong> - to ensure the application works on different form factors; desktop browser, tablet and mobile</li>
<li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong> - to make sure all browsers are supported</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst this isn't directly a startup, the ability to quickly create high impact, interactive applications which gain big traction could certainly be a service offering that would be of big interest to lots of other brands and companies.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/06/27/cloud9-introduce-realtime-collaborative-editing-to-their-online-ide.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In my recent talks I always give realtime collaborative code editing as a great example of collaboration. As far as I know <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9</a> are the first to add this features to an online IDE (I've heard such a feature has been available in desktop IDEs for a while).</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/V7Kx9Hd5EYY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They use <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> for their solution, which isn't a surprise since they're big on node.js.</p>
<p>The recent mail-out must have really driven some traffic they're way as they've reported:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We are experiencing the highest demand in our history. If you are having issues with your workspace, we are fixing issues now. Sit tight!</p>
<p>&mdash; Cloud9 IDE (@Cloud9IDE) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloud9IDE/status/218042492564684800" data-datetime="2012-06-27T18:05:55+00:00">June 27, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>I wonder how much this increase in traffic was influence by this new awesome realtime functionality?</strong></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently gave a my Realtime Web Apps in the Wild talk at <a href="http://fluentconf.com">Fluent Conference</a> in San Francisco. It's a pretty big event with some impressive and well-informed speakers, so it was great to be part of.</p>
<h3 id="slides:"><a href="#slides:">Slides:</a></h3>
<p>You can find the slides from the talk in the mode which controls the second screen application here:<br />
<a href="/pres/fluent2012/pres/?a71b8d8b7eef0ef6d98c"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rtwaw_slides-300x191.png" alt="" title="Realtime Web Apps in the Whild" width="300" height="191" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-23297" /></a></p>
<p>The slides also contain links to the demo videos for the appropriate slides, identified by this image:<br />
<img src="/pres/assets/images/tv.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Remember to check out the cool <a href="http://ghosts.herokuapp.com">Ghosts demo</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this realtime technology then why not <a href="http://pusher.com/signup">sign up for a free Pusher account</a> and add some realtime functionality to your web or mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="websocket-v-http-latency"><a href="#websocket-v-http-latency">WebSocket v HTTP latency</a></h3>
<p>I was asked some information about HTTP v WebSocket latency so here are some graphs from some a <a href="http://webtide.intalio.com/2011/09/cometd-2-4-0-websocket-benchmarks/">CometD benchmarks blog post</a> demonstrate latency comparisons.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/05/20/a-year-as-a-developer-evangelist.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I can't believe it, but I've now been working for <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> for a year. It's been an exciting year both in life and in business - and it's great when you spend a lot of the time working on something you are really interested in. So, I thought I'd push out a post covering the things that I've done this year along with a few thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="a-developer-evangelist?"><a href="#a-developer-evangelist?">A Developer Evangelist?</a></h2>
<p>I'm a strong believer that we are much more than a job title and that each person has their own strengths, weaknesses and interests so they should get to work on the things that will most benefit them and through that benefit the company they work for.</p>
<p><img src="http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/9b70782e894511e192e91231381b3d7a_7.jpg" width="500" /><br />
<small>Illustration by <a href="http://twitter.com/ZESanders">@ZESanders</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/IanSanders">@IanSanders</a>' new book <a href="http://tinyurl.com/mashupbook">Mash-Up</a>.</small></p>
<p>But, the job title of "Developer Evangelist", "Technical Evangelist" or "Developer Advocate" does generally mean you do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write blog posts about technology. This could be your product or just interesting technology in general.</li>
<li>Attend events: tech meetups, hack days, hack weekends and conferences.</li>
<li>Talk at events: as above.</li>
<li>Generally use social media to interact with other developers. Blogging is part of this but also Twitter, Google+, irc, StackOverflow and various other channels. It's not an all or nothing thing though.</li>
<li>Keep up to speed with relevant technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be other responsibilities based on the role and the person. I spend quite a bit of time handling support queries. This is a great way of understanding how people are using Pusher and ways in which we could make our service better.</p>
<p>For me the job covers customer support (communication and tech support), marketing, a bit of product strategy and of course development. And probably a bunch of other things from time to time.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough I've never been very keen on public speaking. Yet, it's actually pretty core to this job. So, I'm having to do it even though I'm not sure if I really want to do it or not, I just understand the importance of doing it. In any job you have to try new things and test yourself - this is the biggest test for me.</p>
<p>If you like the sound of this job, we are looking to <a href="http://pusher.com/jobs">hire another Developer Evangelist</a> :)</p>
<p>Finally, I <strong>highly recommend</strong> <a href="http://developer-evangelism.com/">Christian Heilmann's Developer Evangelist handbook</a>. It's one of the things that made me realised that this is what I wanted to do.</p>
<h2 id="a-year-in-review"><a href="#a-year-in-review">A year in review</a></h2>
<p>Here's a list of things that I've done over the past year. But for faster consumption, my highlights have been:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/2011/06/28/recent-article-in-net-magazine-websockets-code-a-real-time-survey.html">Tutorial published in .net magazine</a>. It was really cool so see an article I'd written in print on the shelves of places like WHSmith.</li>
<li>Being on a <a href="/2011/11/09/the-right-place-at-the-right-time-how-the-real-time-web-influences-the-local-world.html">panel at the Local Social Summit</a>. It was really fulfilling to think about social and business aspects of the realtime web.</li>
<li><a href="/2012/02/09/edinburgh-techmeetup-web-browsers-the-realtime-web.html">Talking at Tech Meetup Edinburgh</a>. I've been to techmeetup a few times so it felt really good, after the event, to have spoken and my talk seemed to have gone down well.</li>
<li>Getting involved in <a href="/2012/03/19/code-africa-the-impact-of-realtime.html">Code Africa at News International</a>. It was great to be part of a team that produced something really usable and with a real application in such a short space of time.</li>
<li><a href="coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/09/building-real-time-commenting-system">Tutorial published in Smashing Magazine</a></li>

They saw what I had done with Kwwika, and despite having to deal with the occasional <strong>massive</strong> email from me, have given me the opportunity to continue doing something I really believe in - helping others understand and use realtime web technologies.</p>
<p>Finally, finally - since I'm in San Francisco I get to publish this blog post whilst sitting in <a href="http://yerbabuenagardens.com/">Yerba Buena Gardens</a>. Pretty cool!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Really pleased to see my <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/09/building-real-time-commenting-system/">realtime commenting system blog post</a> appearing on <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a>. The post took a reasonable amount of time to write but I really like the way that the application is built from near-scratch and is progressively enhanced, first with AJAX and then realtime web functionality.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>My opinion, indicated in the comments below, is now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comet is an umbrella term for all the old HTTP-based hacks and is a phrase we want to get rid of. WebSockets are where we want to be; browsers and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the old post covering my original opinion:</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>"WebSockets or Comet"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking about writing about this frequently used statement for a while, and I’ve seen a few comments and discussions previously about this e.g. from <a href="http://twitter.com/martintyler">Martin Tyler</a> of <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a> and Peter Lubbers of <a href="http://kaazing.com">Kaazing</a> in a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/Web-Sockets-Proxy-Servers#view_54559">post on InfoQ</a>).</p>
<p>Martin's point of view is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing I don't understand is your stance on Comet. You seem to want to distance Kaazing from Comet, despite the fact that your WebSocket emulation is surely Comet. More than this though, WebSocket itself is also Comet since Comet is just a paradigm, not a any specific transport mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter's opinion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comet is a programming model that allows a web server to push data to a browser. This is often achieved through a long-held HTTP request, but there really is no standard or specification for Comet; it is just an umbrella term for all the different ways that can be used to achieve this.</p>
<p>WebSocket, on the other hand, is a well-defined API and protocol that allows for full-duplex, bidirectional communication (not just server push).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you really say WebSockets is an alternative to Comet when Comet servers use WebSockets?</p>
<p>My current thinking is the same as Martin's (I did used to work with Martin). It is that:</p>
<p><strong>Comet is a paradigm, not only for server push but also for bi-directional communication.</strong></p>
<p>The need to do this with a web browser resulted in WebSockets – something which natively supported this in a way that HTTP did not. So, we have Comet to thank for WebSockets.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_&#40;programming&#41;">Wikipedia Comet entry</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it. Comet is an umbrella term, encompassing multiple techniques for achieving this interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex Russell’s <a href="http://infrequently.org/2006/03/comet-low-latency-data-for-the-browser/">original Comet blog post</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, they all use long-lived HTTP connections to reduce the latency with which messages are passed to the server.</p>
<p>The architecture relies on a view of data which is event driven on both sides of the HTTP connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All very HTTP related. <strong>But</strong> the second quote interestingly says <strong>“event driven on both sides”</strong>. This bi-directional communication, backed up by the diagram from the web post (see below), seems to have been lost in the wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Original Comet diagram by Alex Russell. <small><a href="http://infrequently.org/2006/03/comet-low-latency-data-for-the-browser/">source</a></small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What I’m suggesting is that Comet is a paradigm for realtime bi-directional communication between a server and a client. Initially it used long-lived HTTP connections in addition to a second short-lived connection for command requests (e.g. subscribe) <strong>because it was the only solution</strong>. Comet servers now use WebSockets because they are now available, are better than the HTTP-based alternatives and help Comet (the paradigm) be achieved and finally truly realised in a standardised way.</p>
<p>I’m suggesting that HTTP Long-Polling or HTTP-Streaming (all using XMLHttpRequest, Script tag polling, IFRAMES, ActiveX objects) and WebSockets are transfer technologies (Martin used the term "transfer mechanism") that make the Comet paradigm possible.</p>
<p>I’m suggesting that saying “Comet or WebSockets” is an invalid statement and that the Wikipedia article is incorrect and that this diagram better reflects the relationship between WebSockets and Comet:</p>

<p>I’m prepared to be wrong by being convinced otherwise. But I don't think I am or will. Interested in hearing your opinions.</p>

Over the weekend I attended the Code Africa hack weekend which was organised and hosted by <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/">The Times</a>. The event saw developers, designers, journalists and entrepreneurs come together to try and form ideas and build prototypes over one weekend. My main takeaways from the event were a much better understanding of the state of technology in Africa, how technology can be used to help the people living within the continent and how <strong>realtime technologies can be used not only to improve application functionality, but also provide real impact</strong> in demonstrations and presentations.</p>

<p>At the end of the second day each idea was given three minutes to pitch, and if possible demo. And today (Monday, March 19) they will be pitching to a group of 100 people including numerous company CEOs, at least two country presidents and a former Prime Minister at The Times CEO Summit Africa (<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/ceo-summit-africa/?service=rss">RSS news feed</a>) - a real opportunity to potentially get funding and affect change.</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-realtime"><a href="#the-impact-of-realtime">The Impact of Realtime</a></h2>
<p>Public speaking is quite new to me. In the past couple of years I've spoken at just a handful of events. However, over the past few weeks I've give more talks than ever about Realtime web technologies, including a lightening talk yesterday at CodeAfrica.</p>
<p>The more talks and workshops I give the more I realise that no amount of speaking will beat actually demonstrating a realtime web technology. But not only demonstrating, also using the technology to make the audience part of the presentation, and make it an interactive presentation which encourages discussion and stimulates ideas.</p>
<p>I saw this again yesterday when Daniel Probert, who lead the Simple SMS Education team which I was part of, demoed the prototype. As part of his three minute pitch Daniel used the prototype web app to send a question via SMS (thanks to <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> to a number of people in the room. They then reply to that SMS with the answer to the question. These answers are instantly displayed within the prototype application (thanks to Twilio WebHooks and <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>). This was described by one of the feedback panel as <em>"A killer demonstration"</em>.</p>
<p>The ability to instantly demonstrate interaction between multiple people using SMS and realtime web technologies has a real WOW-factor. I've used this sort of technology for over 10 years and I'm still excited and wowed by it!</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-&amp;-thanks"><a href="#final-thoughts-&amp;-thanks">Final Thoughts &amp; Thanks</a></h2>
<p>CodeAfrica was organised and ran by <a href="https://twitter.com/federicacocco">Federica Cocco</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/petermacrobert">Peter MacRobert</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TomWhitwell">Tom Whitwell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/xenophin">Xen Lategan</a> so they deserve a lot of credit for a great event and bringing so many interesting and creative people together.</p>
<p>It was also great to work with <a href="https://twitter.com/anibe">Anibe Agamah</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbprobert">Daniel Probert</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tianjianfeng">Jianfeng Tian</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/iliasbartolini">Ilias Bartolini</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/andreiashu">Andrei Simion</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonaCiocoiu">Simona Ciocoiu</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://i54.twitgoo.com/1h8j91.jpg" width="600" alt="Simple SMS Education standup" /></p>
<p>With my core interest in technologies being realtime technologies I thought that the lack of Internet infrastructure (mobile data networks) in some areas of Africa was going to mean that I wouldn't be able to use this technology over the weekend. However, it was used (and will be used today in Daniel's pitch) to add real impact when demonstrating how technology can really make a difference.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/02/19/jquery-uk-2012-event-dont-always-use-jquery.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/02/19/jquery-uk-2012-event-dont-always-use-jquery.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>I started writing this right after the jQuery UK event but have only just found time to finish it off sitting in Stansted airport at 7am.</em></p>
<p>jQuery is a funny thing; it's made JavaScript coding easy for advanced developers and accessible to web designers, and you could even say that the web designer role has very much changed because of it. It's made web interfaces much richer and interactive. But, it's also made us lazy because it's so easy to use. It's time to take a step back and start thinking about best practices. And sometimes that might mean <em>not using</em> jQuery.</p>
<p>I was really pleased to hear <a href="http://twitter.com/codepo8">Christian Heilmann</a>'s talk on moving back to using native methods, rather than always using jQuery (you can read Christian's write-up and get see his slides <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2012/02/11/jquery-uk-conference-in-oxford-england-slides-audio-impressions-and-notes/">here</a>). His reasons for this were:</p>
<ul>
<li>To encourage education about native browser functionality</li>
<li>Native browser methods can perform better</li>
</ul>
<p>This latter point is of particular interest to me. Whilst at <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a> I was part of a development team where performance was critical. We were (they still are) building realtime web libraries and UIs which need to deal with both high frequency of data updates and large data sets displayed within the UI. I met up with <a href="http://twitter.com/fauna5">Rich Chamberlain</a>, Caplin's dev manager, about a month ago and he reminded me of this. So, I set about comparing <code>document.getElementById('someId')</code> with <code>$('#someId')</code> and unsurprisingly the native method was by far superior.</p>
<p>For the results of this, and to test for yourself, see <a href="/2012/02/12/considerations-when-updating-the-dom-to-display-realtime-data.html">Considerations when updating the DOM to display realtime data</a>.</p>
<p>What was surprising was just how much better <code>document.getElementById</code> is. You would assume (I haven't looked at the source) that within the <code>$</code> function that the selector would simply be checked:</p>
<pre><code>$ = function(selector) {
  if( isIdSelector(selector) ) {
    var el = document.getElementById(selector);
    return warpInJQueryStuff(el); // el could be null
  }
  // else …
};
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, it's probably nothing like this. But you get the idea. So, what is it that makes using jQuery comparatively so expensive? My guess is that it's the <code>warpInJQueryStuff</code>. One of the parts of jQuery that makes it so powerful (all those functions you can call after selecting elements, and the chaining functionality e.g.</p>
<pre><code>$('.something')
.doSomething()
.doSomethingElse()
.soOn();
</code></pre>
<p>The same goes when the <code>selector</code> isn't just an <code>id</code> attribute selector i.e. a more advance CSS query.</p>
<pre><code>$ = function(selector) {
  if( isIdSelector(selector) ) {
    //...
  }
  else if( isQuerySelector(selector) ) {
    var els = document.querySelector(selector); //**TODO: check**
    return wrapInjQueryStuff(els);
  }
  // else …
};
</code></pre>
<p>The jQuery library shoots itself in the foot a little bit here because they've added non-CSS selectors (I can't find an example right now but <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=teb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=jquery+non-standard+selectors#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;q=jquery+%22non-standard+selectors%22&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=jquery+%22non-standard+selectors%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=3&amp;gs_upl=3450l5414l0l5599l4l4l0l0l0l2l966l1518l5-1.1l2l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a16cf6b4817c4ef9&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=746&amp;ix=teb">a google</a> suggests this is correct). However, this isn't anything that a <code>RegExp</code> couldn't test for and if the jQuery-specific selectors aren't found then the native function can be used. Again, maybe it's the <code>wrapInjQueryStuff</code> that's the problem?</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is: don't always use jQuery. As with anything, consider what you are trying to achieve and if performance matters, or you just want to learn, use the native methods instead. But remember to check for <a href="http://caniuse.com/queryselector">browser support</a>.</p>
<p>If performance matters and you find this type of thing interesting then Doug Neiner's talk on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dcneiner/contextual-jquery">Contextual jQuery</a> will probably interest you too.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2012/02/12/considerations-when-updating-the-dom-to-display-realtime-data.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When data is being delivered to web applications the chances are that you'll be displaying that data within the user interface (UI). In order to do this you need to find the element in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">Document Object Model</a> (DOM) and then update it. Whilst the performance of web browsers is improving all the time DOM manipulation can still be costly (use up time and resources) if you are pushing through a lot of data so it's worth keeping the interaction with the DOM to a minimum. You should also consider how you access the DOM. Should you use a utility/library function or should you use native browser methods?</p>

<p>To demonstrate this, and show the considerations I've written a few small helper functions which can be called a number of times from tests and for each test I'll time how long it takes to update the DOM a certain number of times.</p>

<p>For many web developers a script tag referencing in the jQuery library is one of the first elements to be added to any web page - it's even in some web framework templates by default. So, a good first test is to time how long it takes for jQuery to update an element a number of times.</p>

<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.min.js"></script>

<pre><code class="js" data-code="testDefinitions_jQueryNoCache"></code></pre>

<script data-code-target="testDefinitions_jQueryNoCache">
var methods = {};
var elId = 'updateMe';
methods.jQueryNoCache = function(value) {
  jQuery('#' + elId).text(value);
};
</script>

<p>Now that we've defined one way of updating the DOM let's add a way of caching a reference to the jQuery object that we create with the <code>jQuery(selector)</code> call. So, instead of having to make that call each time we can just access the object from a cache. This means that a new <code>jQuery</code> object doesn't need to be created for every update.</p>

<pre><code class="js" data-code="testDefinitions_jQueryCache"></code></pre>

<script data-code-target="testDefinitions_jQueryCache">
var cache = {};
methods.jQueryCache = function(value) {
  if(!cache['#' + elId]) {
    cache['#' + elId] = jQuery('#' + elId);
  }
  cache['#' + elId].text(value);
};
</script>

<p>jQuery uses CSS selectors to find elements so rather than going directly to single elements using <code>id</code> attributes let's also define a test that uses a nested selector: <code>div.top div.middle div.bottom p.update-me</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="js" data-code="testDefinitions_jQueryCSSSelectorNoCache"></code></pre>

<script data-code-target="testDefinitions_jQueryCSSSelectorNoCache">
  var elCSSSelector = 'div.top div.middle div.bottom p.update-me';
  methods.jQueryCSSSelectorNoCache = function(value) {
   jQuery(elCSSSelector).text(value);
  };
</script>

<div class="top" style="width: 5px; height: 5px; overflow: hidden;">
  <div class="middle">
    <div class="bottom">
      <p class="update-me"></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Finally, as a comparison let's define functions which update the DOM by directly using the native <code>document.getElementById</code> and <code>document.querySelector</code> native browser functions, and both of these again using the caching technique we used earlier.</p>

<pre><code class="js" data-code="testDefinitions_byId"></code></pre>

<script data-code-target="testDefinitions_byId">
methods.byIdNoCache = function(value) {
  document.getElementById(elId).innerText = value;
};
methods.querySelectorNoCache = function(value) {
  document.querySelector(elCSSSelector).innerText = value;
};
methods.byIdCache = function(value) {
  if(!cache[elId]) {
    cache[elId] = document.getElementById(elId);
  }
  cache[elId].innerText = value;
};
methods.querySelectorCache = function(value) {
  if(!cache[elCSSSelector]) {
    cache[elCSSSelector] = document.querySelector(elCSSSelector);
  }
  cache[elId].innerText = value;
};
</script>

<p>If we execute each of these methods so that they are called 500 times to update the DOM and repeat that 10 times we see results as shown in the following graph.</p>

<figure>
  <div id="timeSeriesChart"></div>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 10px; padding-top: 5px;">Time in milliseconds (y-axis) it takes to update an element within the DOM <span id="updateMe"></span>(+1) times. The test is ran a number of times (x-axis)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And if we take each of the results and average them out we see the following:</p>

<figure>
  <div id="avgSeriesChart"></div>
  <figcaption style="font-size: 10px; padding-top: 5px;">The chart above shows the average time it takes to find the element and update the DOM using different techniques</figcaption>
</figure>

  <button id="runTestsBtn">Run Tests</button>
</fieldset>

<p>If you'd like to try running the tests with different numbers you can do so using this form. When the tests complete the graphs will update. The numbers have been restricted in an effort to reduce the chances of your web browser hanging.
&lt;/aside&gt;

<script>
$(function() {
  $('#runTestsBtn').click(function() {
    var updates = $('#numUpdates').val();
    var loop = $('#numLoops').val();
    if(isNaN(updates) || isNaN(loop)) {
      return;
    }
    updates = Math.min(updates, 2500);
    loop = Math.min(loop, 25);
    runTests(updates, loop);
  });
})
</script>

<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>The graphs are dynamically generated based on the browser viewing this blog post so the results will differ but even so the graphs suggest to following to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are sending a reasonable number of updates, and you are going to be updated the UI a lot, that you should be using <code>document.getElementById</code> to access and update the DOM.</li>
<li>If you want to use jQuery and the DOM structure isn't going to update all that often then the caching references to jQuery objects is an efficient mechanism.</li>
<li>If you are are using CSS queries then the native <code>document.querySelector</code> performs better than <code>jQuery</code>. In both cases the complexity of the query is undoubtedly going to impact the performance.</li>
<li>Caching lookups of <code>document.querySelector</code> is a good idea since it improves performance.</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly direct <code>id</code> attributes lookups are fastest of all.</li>
<li><code>document.getElementById</code> is the fastest way of accessing the DOM and caching lookups doesn't make a big difference.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important thing is that you will know better than anybody else the sort of data that is going to be pushed into your app and it does with it. Balance performance and maintainability within your application and make decisions about how you are going to deal with updating the DOM based on that.</p>
<p>If your application gets infrequent updates then you'll be fine using jQuery all the time. If your app gets a lot of realtime data streamed to it, maybe it's a trading application, then you'll need to fine-tune your app.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I gave a presentation yesterday at Edinburgh <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">techmeetup</a>. A big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/daleharvey">Dale Harvey</a> for inviting me to talk and to all the attendees for taking the time to attend, listen and interact. <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronbassett">Aaron Bassett</a> also gave a good talk on Avoiding Integration Hell so I'd recommend you follow him for more info.</p>

<p>After the presentation there were a number of good questions asked here they are, and my answers. If you've any other questions please <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=Web Browsers &amp; the Realtime Web Qs">drop me an email</a> or leave a comment.</p>
<h3 id="does-websockets-provide-support-for-common-use-cases?-does-it-natively-support-pub/sub?"><a href="#does-websockets-provide-support-for-common-use-cases?-does-it-natively-support-pub/sub?">Does WebSockets provide support for common use cases? Does it natively support Pub/Sub?</a></h3>
<p>As with most standardised technology WebSockets offer the very basics of what is required to enable realtime bi-directional communication between a server and a client;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>var ws = new WebSocket(url)</code> - connect</li>
<li><code>ws.onopen = function() {};</code> - connected</li>
<li><code>ws.onmessage = function(ev) {};</code> - some data has arrived</li>
<li><code>ws.send({"some":"data"});</code> - send some data to the server</li>
<li><code>ws.onclose = function() {};</code> - the connection has closed</li>
<li><code>ws.close();</code> - close the connection</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want functionality like auto reconnection, connection stability checking (<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/network.html#ping-and-pong-frames">ping/pong is hopefully coming</a>), the ability to subscribe to channels/topics/subjects in order to filter and partition data then you need to build this functionality yourself or user a client/server combination that already offers this. We've built this functionality into our Pusher JavaScript library and service.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-people-on-shared-hosting-use-this-technology?"><a href="#how-do-people-on-shared-hosting-use-this-technology?">How do people on shared hosting use this technology?</a></h3>
<p>If you are on a shared hosting then the hosting provide doesn't tend to like this sort of technology because it requires you to maintain persistent connections between the hosting server and the client. I don't know for sure but I think PHP hosting services may do something to stop this sort of thing from working. However, I'm pretty sure that hosting services like <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> will provide support since <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> is quite possibly one of the most popular packages available. I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if I am. If you know, please get in touch.</p>
<p>A great option here is to use <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> since it remove the need to maintain the persistent connections - it's technology agnostic.</p>
<h3 id="do-websockets-have-problems-with-proxies-and-firewalls?"><a href="#do-websockets-have-problems-with-proxies-and-firewalls?">Do WebSockets have problems with proxies and firewalls?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, but connecting over a secure connection (WSS:// over port 443) will work in the majority of cases. For those cases it doesn't work I've seen HTTP Long-Polling and HTTP Streaming also having problems where proxies and firewalls don't like the long-held requests. It's really a battle between realtime technologies and older Internet infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-spdy-fit-into-the-realtime-web?"><a href="#where-does-spdy-fit-into-the-realtime-web?">Where does SPDY fit into the Realtime Web?</a></h3>
<p>"<a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY is an experimental protocol for a faster web</a>". It's actually used by Google Chrome and a number of Google web apps already (a quick Google suggestions <a href="http://www.datamation.com/open-source/firefox-11-gets-spdy.html">Firefox 11 will support SPDY</a>). The main problem is that in order for this protocol to be used we need the Internet Infrastructure to upgrade. This isn't going to happen to quickly. So, SPDY sounds very promising but it'll be a while until we see it widely adopted/used.</p>
<p>It's easier to move client technology forward (we need IE to auto update), but server technology looks like it'll be slower to move forward.</p>
<p>I recommend keeping an eye on <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2011/04/07/life-beyond-http-11-googles-spdy/">Ilya Grigorik's blog</a> for related tech info.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>real-time web</strong> started off by just being "cool"; a quirky and fun space to be in with lots of "cool" technology. People weren't sure whether it was just a fad, stimulated by hype. The value it delivers in the form of customer engagement, interaction, collaboration and the opportunities it can provide by being real-time is now much clearer, and consequently the benefits of using real-time technologies are beginning to be understood.</p>

<h2 id="realtime-web-technology-accessibility"><a href="#realtime-web-technology-accessibility">Realtime Web Technology Accessibility</a></h2>
<p>One of the problems with real-time technologies over the past 10+ years has been the accessibility. Comet servers were difficult to install, a pain to maintain and upgrade and generally difficult to use due to numerous configuration options and technology quirks, mainly exposed by different web browsers. There have been a number of very important changes have happened over the past few years that now make real-time technologies much more accessible.</p>
<h3 id="web-browser-wars"><a href="#web-browser-wars">Web Browser Wars</a></h3>
<p>For such a long time Internet Explorer 6 was by far the best web browser available. It's the reason that Microsoft "dropped the ball" and why Firefox and Chrome are where they are today. But now we are in a great position of having a number of actively developed web browsers being driven by real competition to offer the best browsing experience. This has lead to a general improvements in browser speed (JavaScript and rendering engines) but also improvements in web technology available to web browsers and, possibly most important of all, web standardisation. <strong>HTML5 does indeed rock!</strong></p>
<h3 id="cloud-hosted-services"><a href="#cloud-hosted-services">Cloud Hosted Services</a></h3>
<p>Cloud hosted services, frequently referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). These hosted solutions take away the pain of installation, maintenance and scaling, and frequently deliver them at a fraction of the cost possible if you were self-hosting.</p>
<h3 id="better-self-hosted-solutions"><a href="#better-self-hosted-solutions">Better self hosted solutions</a></h3>
<p>Cloud hosted services are awesome (I would say that, but they are!) but the <a href="/real-time-web-technologies-guide#self-hosted">self hosted realtime web solutions</a> that are available and the ease of installation has massively improved. As an example, you can have a <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> example page up and running on node.js within minutes. These improvements have been driven by an increased demand for</p>
<h3 id="websockets"><a href="#websockets">WebSockets</a></h3>
<p>WebSockets is a standard for continuous bi-directional single-connection communication between client and server. Real-time technologies, and in particular real-time messaging within a web browser, has been possible before but not until WebSockets has there been a standard that is so likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately WebSockets don't mean that the pain has completely gone away. The technology, whilst more accessible, still isn't as easy as it could be for developers to use. On some platforms WebSocket server installation can still take too long, maintenance is just something developers don't really want to do, and scaling takes time, effort and lots of configuration. So, we turn to the first important change as a solution to this problem - hosted realtime services.</p>
<h2 id="hosted-realtime-services"><a href="#hosted-realtime-services">Hosted realtime services</a></h2>
<p>Hosted realtime services, like <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> who I work for, make it much faster and easier for developers to start adding real-time functionality (push notifications, activity streams, realtime chat, collaboration, realtime data visualisations, multiplayer games, 2nd screen/Social TV experiences etc.) to their applications within minutes. For bigger organisations, the same solution also means that you know your developers are busy adding value, not installing, configuring and maintaining. This means they are happy and productive.</p>
<p>The web is only around 20 years old and the real-time web is younger still. We don't know exactly where the next few years will take the web but I'm sure that HTML5, WebSockets and real-time messaging will be a key component, and services like Pusher in a great position to help provide the infrastructure that developers need to easily use these technologies.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of hours ago I was on a on the 'The Right Place At The Right Time: How The Real-Time Web Influences The "local" World' panel at the <a href="http://www.localsocialsummit.com/">Local Social Summit</a>. The panel was organised and chaired by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sebprovencher">Sebastien Provencher</a> and also included <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ryanmacjones">RyanMacJones</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/daveambrose">Dave Ambrose</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/daveambrose">Stefano Diemmi</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the information about the panel and my thoughts on the questions that were asked.</p>

<h2 id="description"><a href="#description">Description</a></h2>
<p>The rise of the real-time Web is well documented. Propelled by both the social networking revolution and mobile device ubiquitousness, we're seeing the birth of new user services and business opportunities. In this panel,  we will explore the time element in the local/social Web and will try to discover what kind of content works well in real-time, what are the benefits for consumers and what kind of business models can be deployed to leverage the "time" dimension.</p>
<h2 id="questions"><a href="#questions">Questions</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter">Phil Leggetter</a><br />
Developer Evangelist at <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a><br />
Pusher is a cloud hosted service and API that makes it really easy to add cool realtime user engaging functionality, like push notifications, activity streams and chat, to any Web, Mobile, Tablet or Desktop application.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-define-the-real-time-web?-what-is-the-importance-of-the-time-dimension-on-the-web-today?"><a href="#how-do-you-define-the-real-time-web?-what-is-the-importance-of-the-time-dimension-on-the-web-today?">How do you define the real-time Web? What is the importance of the time dimension on the Web today?</a></h3>
<p>Firstly I think we need to define 'realtime'. Realtime means that when information is generated following an event of some kind, that information must be available and received in a timely manner so that the context of that information is not lost; so that the information is still relevant and usable.</p>
<p>The realtime web, made popular by Twitter and the instant availability of information, takes this concept of timely information to the web. To me 'the realtime web' means that instant availability of information but also the instant distribution of that information. It means that those that have registered an interest in a pieces of information will have it pushed to them. It also means we now have the technology available for realtime (timely) bi-directional communication making realtime chat and collaboration using the Internet as the network something that is truly achievable.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-the-time-dimension-expresses-itself-in-your-business?-or-in-the-local/social-universe,-social-media,-daily-deals,-etc.-(feel-free-to-comment/provide-examples-outside-of-your-business-as-well)"><a href="#how-does-the-time-dimension-expresses-itself-in-your-business?-or-in-the-local/social-universe,-social-media,-daily-deals,-etc.-(feel-free-to-comment/provide-examples-outside-of-your-business-as-well)">How does the time dimension expresses itself in your business? or in the local/social universe, social media, daily deals, etc. (feel free to comment/provide examples outside of your business as well)</a></h3>
<p>At a fundamental level Pusher is an Internet realtime messaging service. We aim to keep latency, the time between a message being sent and it being received, as low as possible so it's a core part of our service. The value in realtime is the <strong>opportunity</strong> that receiving information as quickly as possible presents.</p>
<p>The technology behind this comes from a trading background where milliseconds can mean getting the best price and can make the difference between getting a great price for a commodity/stock/share or a bad one. This results in potentially millions of pounds.</p>
<p>Realtime in local and social also results in opportunity. The first to hear about and respond to a deal benefits. Those who are aware of the unexpected U2 concert on a near-by roof top have the opportunity to get there in time to see this one-off event. People aware of a terror threat or some other kind of emergency can act accordingly - either get the hell out of the area or head to it to cover the event or help out. It's all about the opportunity that getting timely data presents.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-content-works-well-in-real-time-web?-are-there-business-categories-that-work-better?"><a href="#what-kind-of-content-works-well-in-real-time-web?-are-there-business-categories-that-work-better?">What kind of content works well in real-time Web? Are there business categories that work better?</a></h3>
<p>Traditionally realtime web technologies have been used in finance because that's where the benefits have been greatest. This means that the content has been pricing information about stocks and shares along with news related to finance.</p>
<p>But with both realtime technology and realtime data much more accessible we are seeing other businesses using and benefiting from it. Sports and betting data is the most obvious second step for this technology. Auctions are a good use and again this is really money driven. Then there's business categories where people just want to get the information as soon as possible. News, sport scores, disaster warning systems, disaster relief and short lived deals are examples. Then there's information around systems that allow for realtime collaboration; where people are working together to discuss and solve problems. Chat is the first obvious example but synchronised document editing is another more complex, yet highly beneficial one.</p>
<p>Twitter demonstrates a form of chat but it's only really good for broadcasting information and for one-to-one chat. If you want a multi-user experience you need to take the conversation away from Twitter. Google hangouts or apps such as <a href="http://blether.co">!blether</a> and <a href="http://nurph.com">Nurph</a> are great for that.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-role-of-“mobile”-in-this-evolution?"><a href="#what-is-the-role-of-“mobile”-in-this-evolution?">What is the role of “mobile” in this evolution?</a></h3>
<p>We're seeing a lot of notification platforms for mobile, but that means the data is going just one way. In some cases this is all that's needed e.g. "Daily Deal X available at Y". But for collaborative applications you need more than just a notification infrastructure. For that we needs better mobile data infrastructure. In London it's fine but where I live in Scotland it's nearly non-existent. So, mobile and local is going to benefit a lot of people but not everybody. Also, mobile data plans need to be revamped to take into account we are becoming more data, and less voice focused.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-for-consumers?-emergency/short-term-need-vs.-long-term-need.-real-time-local-news-(japan-tsunami,-london-riots,-hashtags,-etc.)"><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-for-consumers?-emergency/short-term-need-vs.-long-term-need.-real-time-local-news-(japan-tsunami,-london-riots,-hashtags,-etc.)">What are the benefits for consumers? emergency/Short-term need vs. long term need. Real-time local news (Japan tsunami, London riots, hashtags, etc.)</a></h3>
<p>I think we've already covered this. It's about the opportunity that getting realtime information brings. To know something is going on and get to or away from somewhere as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-business-models-(new-or-not)-that-emerge-when-we-add-the-time-dimension?-yield-management-/last-minute:-real-or-hype?-is-this-real?-groupon-now-disappointing?"><a href="#what-are-the-business-models-(new-or-not)-that-emerge-when-we-add-the-time-dimension?-yield-management-/last-minute:-real-or-hype?-is-this-real?-groupon-now-disappointing?">What are the business models (new or not) that emerge when we add the time dimension? Yield management /last-minute: real or hype? Is this real? Groupon Now disappointing?</a></h3>
<p>There's an excitement generated by having a time constraint. So I think in general we'll see some fun ideas come out of this. I'm particularly excited to see some <strong>2nd Screen</strong> applications that synchronise with live events or scheduled TV programmes. There's an opportunity to add a lot more context and fun to TV beyond what we are watching and I've yet to see a really great example. I'm not a betting guy so I've not tried out <a href="https://picklive.com/">PickLive</a> but for this interested in Football and Fantasy Football I'm sure it's a great experience. I want to see more in this space.</p>
<p>What's the business model? Probably synchronised contextual advertising and also increased user engagement in a programme, and TV figures mean more advertising revenue.</p>

<p>Adding realtime functionality to an application is now easier than it's ever been. In the past few years the technologies allowing realtime communication have improved and are much more accessible. Scaling and maintain such technology stacks can still be a problem which is one of the features that Pusher offers.</p>
<p>For a true realtime experience the best technology in my opinion is <a href="http://pusher.com/websockets">WebSockets</a>. They allow for low latency true bi-directional communication over the Internet. There are other HTTP-based techniques but they suffer from the overhead inherent in HTTP such as the additional load of HTTP Headers sent with each HTTP request. Browser techniques which do work have to be implemented in different ways in different web browsers. The standardised approach being taken with WebSockets means that it will become the best way of implementing realtime server to client bi-directional communication.</p>
<p>Technologies worth a mention include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>: a hosted realtime service with APIs that make it really easy to add realtime user engaging functionality to a web, mobile, tablet or desktop app. Have I already said that? :)</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a>: provides a way to subscribe to RSS feeds so that new content is instantly pushed to you as soon as it's available. It's a server to server technology and has been used more recently to let you subscribe to any arbitrary data, not just RSS. <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> is big in the tech community because JavaScript is generally big on the Web and Node let's you code in JavaScript on the server and client.</li>
<li><a href="http://socket.io">Socket.io</a> is frequently used to add realtime functionality to Node apps.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream">SocketStream</a>: WebSocket-powered web framework dedicated to creating single-page real time websites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-the-real-time-web-to-local-shops/local-commerce-of-real-time-web?-location-based,-customers-on-the-go."><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-the-real-time-web-to-local-shops/local-commerce-of-real-time-web?-location-based,-customers-on-the-go.">What are the benefits of the real-time Web to local shops/local commerce of real-time Web? location-based, customers on the go.</a></h3>
<p>The ability to let people know of short term deals or the ability to sell perishable goods at the end of the day that would otherwise be wasted. I've heard of a product called <a href="http://www.sicamp.org/si-camp-uk/scotland-2011/ideas/foodini/">Foodini</a> that might be doing something in this space. FourSquare check-in can still provide more value to encourage meetups in areas where groups of friends hang out.</p>
<h3 id="typically-real-time-does-not-allow-for-a-lot-of-context-beyond-short-bits-of-info.-how-does-context-play-a-deeper-role-as-we-move-forward-in-a-real-time-world?"><a href="#typically-real-time-does-not-allow-for-a-lot-of-context-beyond-short-bits-of-info.-how-does-context-play-a-deeper-role-as-we-move-forward-in-a-real-time-world?">Typically real time does not allow for a lot of context beyond short bits of info. How does context play a deeper role as we move forward in a real time world?</a></h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, context is absolutely key to getting real value from realtime information. Without context the data can be worthless. When something has a time constraint then context has to be present. Applications such as FourSquare add the context which gives it real value. Who has checked-in, where have they checked-in, what type of place have they checked-in to. All this key information let's anybody viewing the check-in decide what to do. Tweets normally rely on you knowing a user. If you've missed the start of a conversation thread between two users you follow then, depending on the time constraints, the opportunity could be lost.</p>
<p>Context is essential and as realtime web applications move forward this is most definitely the area where we need to, and will, see improvement.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just finished reading chapter 2 of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0273755676/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0273755676">Zoom! The faster way to make your business idea happen</a> and to use one of <a href="http://scrambledup.blogspot.com/">Ian Sanders</a> favourite words it really "resonated" with me and my experiences with <a href="http://kwwika.com/">Kwwika</a>.</p>
<div style="margin:20px;text-align:centre; float:right;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0273755676/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0273755676"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0273755676&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=philleggsoftc-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0273755676" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></div>
<p>Chapter 2 is entitled "The trouble with too much planning. How to unplan your business". I've been following Ian for probably around three years now and for around the last two he's been talking, <a href="http://twitter.com/iansanders">tweeting</a>, blogging and vlogging about unplanning your business.</p>

<p>I had tried to unplan Kwwika. The fact that it was a great idea, I had real passion for it and had a lot of potential to be used in many different ways unfortunately wasn't enough for everybody involved. There had to be more of a business plan. This meant documents and spreadsheets. These documents and spreadsheets alone didn't clearly show a massive turnover. But the spreadsheets were full of best guess estimates and didn't take into account all the various possibilities and things that hadn't even been thought of yet - how could they? Kwwika didn't need a plan beyond the basics we already had in place. We had enough information to see that it was a great idea and had lots potential. What it needed was more faith, commitment* and belief in the idea.</p>
<p><em>*It would probably be better to say that the commitment needed re-focused since there was plenty of time, effort and money spent on the project.</em></p>
<p>Chapter 2 in Zoom! talks about a business idea needing a 'why' and a 'who'. <strong>Why</strong> a business is needed and <strong>Who</strong> will make it happen. The Why for Kwwika has now been justified by services like <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>, of which I'm now part, and the competitors PubNub and Beacon Push. There is absolutely no reason why Kwwika couldn't still be running and competing too. The problem lies in the belief in the 'why' and the restrictive nature of the 'who', where a big part of the 'who' was me.</p>
<p>One of the things that <a href="http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> talks about quite a bit is the importance of concentrating on what you are good at. If you're not good at something, or if you know it could be done better by somebody else, then find that somebody else and get them to do it. This means you can focus on the things you are good at. We didn't do this with Kwwika and it was partly my fault. It was my fault because I was on a good salary, knew the project was constantly under review and knew that at the start of 2012 I wanted to buy a home for my family. These all conflicted with how I should have approached Kwwika. My salary shouldn't have been a salary at all. It should have been a budget to spend as required in order to give Kwwika a better chance of being successful.</p>
<p>Knowing, or admitting, you are not good at something can be a difficult thing. I'm actually reasonably open and honest about this. I think I know what my strengths and weaknesses are although I do try to put myself in situations which I'd say are outside of my comfort zone. One example of this is that I actually really enjoy working with others although I work from home so quite frequently have to work alone. Another is giving talks. Since a kid, and a particularly bad experience trying to give a talk about the football team I was captain of, I've never been too keen on giving talks or presentations. But I'm now trying to put myself in situations where I have to do this to get over this worry, increase my confidence and to try and improve as a person.</p>
<p>All this feeds in very well to chapter 3 of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0273755676/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0273755676">Zoom!</a>, "Getting to grips with your mission. Why you need to understand what's driving you". More to come as I read on.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With the arrival of <a href="http://pusher.com/websockets">WebSockets</a> we finally have a standardised technology for true realtime bi-directional communication between a server and a web browser (or any other client). When we were creating our <a href="http://pusher.com/websockets">What are WebSockets?</a>  page we decided to write up a history of the technologies that came before and that are in some cases still in use today. How did we (developers) achieve <strong>realtime browser push</strong> before WebSockets and what were the downfalls of those technologies which meant they never really became mainstream? Here's that write-up.</p>
<p>The Internet wasn't originally built to be all that dynamic. It was conceived to be a collection of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages linking to one another to form a conceptual web of information. Over time the static resources increased in number and richer items, such as images, began to be part of the web fabric. Server technologies advanced allowing for dynamic server pages - pages whose content was generated based a query.</p>
<h3 id="dhtml"><a href="#dhtml">DHTML</a></h3>
<p>Soon there was a requirement for the Internet client, the web browser, to be more dynamic, for it to offer a richer experience. This was achieved through browser scripting in the form of VBScript and JavaScript and was known as Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language (DHTML). Whilst this improved the web browser experience to some degree it still fell short in allowing a true application experience to be built within the web browser - the web pages still needed to refresh and reload relatively frequently.</p>
<h3 id="cross-frame-communication"><a href="#cross-frame-communication">Cross Frame Communication</a></h3>
<p>As web browsers evolved so did the scripting technologies and the techniques employed when using them. Application-style functionality was achieved within websites though tricks such as cross frame communication.  These techniques allowed new data to be loaded from the server without the page refreshing by a frame loading a new page from the server and in doing so retrieving new information.</p>
<p>Up until this point all actions within a website, web page or web application had consistent of a user action generating a request to a server from the web browser. But what if the web server had some new, additional information for the user?</p>
<h3 id="http-polling"><a href="#http-polling">HTTP Polling</a></h3>
<p>The first solution to this problem was for the client to poll the server at regular intervals. This solution was, and still is, inefficient and leads to stale data being displayed in web pages and applications.</p>
<h3 id="liveconnect"><a href="#liveconnect">LiveConnect</a></h3>
<p>The next step in the evolution of the web and web applications was for developers to find a way for the server to push new information to the to the web browser from the server. This was first achieved through the use of Java applets which could create a long-held connection with the server and communicate with JavaScript in the web page through a feature known as <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveConnect">LiveConnect</a></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="forever-frame"><a href="#forever-frame">Forever Frame</a></h3>
<p>The LiveConnect technique was relatively quickly superseded, due to Java Virtual machine inconsistencies, by a native browser technique known as <strong><a href="http://cometdaily.com/2007/11/05/the-forever-frame-technique/">forever frame</a></strong> where a long-lived HTTP connection is established to the server using a hidden frame. Data, usually &lt;script&gt; blocks, can then be pushed from the server to the client over this connection and incrementally executed by the web browser.</p>
<h3 id="ajax"><a href="#ajax">AJAX</a></h3>
<p>Then, thanks to Microsoft's requirements with their Outlook web application, the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object was born introducing at technology that made something we all now know as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>) possible. The ability to make a request to the server from JavaScript without the need for any cross frame communication, often referred to as a hack, had been long awaited. Other browser vendors slowly but surely introduced support for the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and without it being an official standard it became one.</p>
<h3 id="http-long-polling-and-xhr-streaming"><a href="#http-long-polling-and-xhr-streaming">HTTP Long-Polling and XHR Streaming</a></h3>
<p>Additional techniques arrived including <strong>script tag long-polling</strong>, <strong>htmlfile ActiveX Object</strong>, <strong>XHR long-polling</strong>, <strong>XHR multipart-replace</strong> and <strong>XHR Streaming</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>long-polling</strong> techniques work by establishing a connection to the server which is held open. When the server has more data for the client it sends that data through and closes the connection. The client then re-establishes the connection and waits for any new data. The main problem with this technique is that during the reconnection process the data on the page could be out of date and inaccurate.</p>
<p><strong>XHR multipart-replace</strong> and <strong>XHR Streaming</strong> are much better HTTP solutions since they maintain a connection between the client and the server. Even so the long-polling solutions were more popular due cross browser inconsistencies with XHR multipart-replace and XHR Streaming. XHR multipart-replace, which was potentially the best solution of all, only works in Gecko-based browsers. XHR Streaming worked in all browsers the <code>responseText</code> of the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object would continue to grow until the connection was closed meaning a reconnection had to eventually be forced to clear this buffer.</p>
<h3 id="bi-directional-communication-(and-the-two-connection-limit)"><a href="#bi-directional-communication-(and-the-two-connection-limit)">Bi-directional Communication (and the two connection limit)</a></h3>
<p>One of the problems with all of the realtime browser solutions so far was that they all required two HTTP connections. The first HTTP connection is used as the back/data/streaming channel where data is sent from the server to the client. A second connection is required to send commands for things such as logging in, changing subscriptions and publishing events/messages. To begin with this caused quite a few problems due to a two 'same domain' connection limit enforced by web browsers which could lead to slow loading pages or the connection in a second browser window failing to establish at all. All modern browsers now have a high same domain connection limit which means this is much less of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="cross-domain-support"><a href="#cross-domain-support">Cross domain support</a></h3>
<p>For a long time we've been able to embed a <code>script</code> tag on our site from CDNs to save us bandwidth and benefit from browser caching. One big restriction with scripting however is that script running on a web page can only communicate with other scripts executing in the same domain. For example, if a page served from pusher.com contained an <code>iframe</code> serving news.bbc.co.uk then script in these web pages would not be able to communicate with one another, and rightly so. This restriction was also enforced for the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object; If script was running in a page on pusher.com the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> could only be made to a resource on pusher.com. In an age where web services are everywhere and usage of such services are encouraged for things such as mashups then this became quite a big restriction. This additionally meant that anybody trying to develop an application using a realtime push technology had to host their realtime server on the same domain as their website. This meant they <strong>had to</strong> self host. Again, in a time where <strong>cloud hosting</strong>, <strong>cloud services</strong>, <strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong>, <strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> are so popular this was a massive restriction.</p>
<p>The need for this <strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a></strong> lead to the introduction of the <strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-hea">Access-Control-Allow-Origin header</a></strong> which allowed the server to indicate to the browser making the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> whether that request was actually allowed.</p>
<p>Even with CORS things weren't as simple as they should be. The forever frame v XHR long-polling v XHR streaming v XHR multipart-replace decision still needed to be made along with the new additional quirk of Internet Explorer adding its very own object, <code>XDomainRequest</code>, which had to be used for cross domain web requests.</p>
<p>These inconsistencies between web browsers and the multitude of 'realtime browser solutions' meant that barrier to using realtime push functionality, not to mention bi-directional communication, was still too high.</p>
<p><strong>But now we have <a href="http://pusher.com/websockets">WebSockets</a></strong>!</p>

      <title><![CDATA[JavaScript namespace utility]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/08/23/javascript-namespace-utility.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/08/23/javascript-namespace-utility.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 10 or so years I've written a lot of JavaScript. From very early on, at <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a>, I had to write things in a way which ensured that code was clear, usable, discoverable, reusable, extensible and can easily built upon. One of the concepts that was used was to put code within a namespace. This ensured that you couldn't accidentally override a function in the global <code>window</code> namespace and also meant that the namespace would describe the sort of functionality contained within. I've continued to use this concept in various forms but just realised that I've never actually shared how I do this. So here goes.</p>
<p>It's actually really simple. I've got two functions that I use, and I've recently ported over to the <code>com.pusher</code> namespace since I'm creating demos for my work (and play). The first creates some default namespace objects and then defines a <code>namespace</code> function that can be used from then on to create any other namespace objects.</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * @namespace
 * Top-level namespace to stop namespace clutter.
 */
if(!window["com"]) {
  window["com"] = {};
}

// create pusher ns
if(!com.pusher) {
  com.pusher = {};
}

/**
 * Ensures that a namespace exists.
 * @param {String} namespace The namespace to check for and create if required.
 *
 * @return {Object} The existing or new namespace.
 */
com.pusher.namespace = function(namespace) {
  var parts = namespace.split(".");
  var context = window;
  var nsPath = "";
  for(var i = 0, l = parts.length; i &lt; l; ++i) {
    var name = parts[i];
    if(!context[name]) {
      context[name] = {};
      context[name].__namespace = name;      
    }
    nsPath += name + ".";
    context = context[name];
    if(!context.__namespace) {
      context.__namespace = nsPath.substring(0, nsPath.length-1); // trim off '.'
    }
  }
  return context;
};
</code></pre>
<p>A quick example of this might be:</p>
<pre><code>com.pusher.namespace("my.new.namespace");

my.new.namespace.SomeClass = function() {
};
/* define methods etc. */
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can access the class anywhere using:</p>
<pre><code>var instance = new my.new.namespace.SomeClass();
</code></pre>
<p>The second function that I've only just started to use takes a leaf from <strong>node.js</strong>. It in that it passes in an <code>exports</code> variable which represents the newly created namespace and then you can add items to that namespace.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'd previously called the <code>exports</code> variable called <code>export</code> but it would appear this is a reserved word in Safari &amp; Firefox</em></p>
<pre><code>com.pusher.define = function(namespace, definition) {
  var exports = {};
  definition(exports);

  var nsObject = com.pusher.namespace(namespace);
  for(var thingToexports in exports) {
    nsObject[thingToexports] = exports[thingToexports];
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>You'll noticed that it uses the <code>com.pusher.namespace</code> function to create the namespace object. The usage of this is then as follows:</p>
<pre><code>com.pusher.namespace("my.new.namespace", function(exports) {

  var SomeClass = function() {
  };
  /* define methods etc. */

  exports.SomeClass = SomeClass;
});
</code></pre>
<p>The class can then be accessed in the same way as shown previously:</p>
<pre><code>var instance = new my.new.namespace.SomeClass();
</code></pre>
<p>I like this last way of doing things as you declare the namespace at the top and wrap everything in a function. You then can pick what you want to expose to the outside world by just adding it to the <code>exports</code> variable.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear what you think about this approach. Do you have a better one?</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/08/18/it-makes-me-mad.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I value honesty, fairness and thoughtfulness above many other things. And I believe that the way I conduct myself reflects these values. I don't do this through any real thought process. It's driven by a physical feeling. It's difficult to explain, but I feel it in my chest. When I feel I've been treated unfairly I just have a sensation of unfairness, lack of care and thought. When I see others treated unfairly I have the same feeling. It annoys me, it makes me mad, and it adds to my drive to make sure that I am fair, honest and thoughtful. I want to treat others how I want to be treated.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21743 " title="It makes me mad!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-18-at-12.17.01.png" alt="It makes me mad!" width="413" height="247" /></p>

<p>Annoyance is a negative emotion and I'd like to be a bit more laid back. But unfortunately the phrase "it's like water off a duck's back" doesn't apply to me. When I'm annoyed I look at the thing that's caused the combination of feelings and emotions and analyse what could have been done better and what should have been done with fairness in mind. It's really this that drives my philosophy and passion in customer service.</p>
<p>This might sound like a simple philosophy, and fundamentally it is, but it's actually really difficult. I want to be 100% open and honest but whilst honesty is absolutely possible there are some pieces of information you can't divulge due to contracts, business considerations or simply setting expectations that might not be met. I want to try to correctly set expectations based on the information that I have but there are external factors that can end up impacting the things I've set expectations on. This can lead to letting people down. This can be as easy as saying "I'll get back to you tomorrow morning" and then other things become a bigger priority and I don't get back to somebody until the afternoon or the next day. I feel really bad about this so what are the alternatives?</p>
<p>One is to manage these expectations without committing. This means using words such as "maybe", "possibly" and "probably". Whilst this resolves the issue of guaranteeing that something will be delivered, or that you'll get back to somebody by a certain time, it also has a negative feeling about it. By not committing you never guarantee anything so what's the point? This approach annoys me, so isn't an option.</p>
<p>Ultimately it comes down to setting rock solid expectations and communication.</p>
<p>To set solid expectations this you need as much data as possible to be able to make the right decision. You also need experience to be able to foresee problems or things that might impact estimates. You need to be able to know how much of a buffer to add on to projected delivery dates in order to let others know when they really should expect something.</p>
<p>Communication is actually really easy. We have so many communication tools at our disposal; email, Twitter, blogs, instant messenger and many more. With these there's not reason why we can't keep others informed of progress or even simply let them know that they've not been forgotten and that their problem or query will be dealt with. Sometimes this is enough.</p>
<p>I don't believe a formulae can't be applied here, there are too many factors. It requires experience, common sense a sense of what is right and the authority to be able to make a decision.</p>
<p>In taking on the Developer Evangelist job at <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> I've also asked to take on the majority of the support. This is sometimes seen as a burden but I think it's a great opportunity to exercise some of my ideas and philosophy as well as to get to know the people using our service. It's also a great way of learning how best to set expectations. And it is a learning process and I don't expect to get things right 100% of the time. But I do guarantee that I'll always be putting myself in the shoes of those making the support request and that I'll do everything I can to make sure their questions are answered to the best of my ability and that their expectations are met.</p>
<h4 id="side-note:"><a href="#side-note:">Side note:</a></h4>
<p>Ironically, I'm sitting on the train next to a young girl who has booked travel using her company credit card. The ticket she's booked means she needs to bring this credit card with her. After she had booked the ticket she noticed this term so treble-checked with <a href="http://www.eastcoast.co.uk">East Coast</a> who told her it would be fine as long as she had ID with her. She had her driving licence with her but was told by the conductor that this wasn't acceptable and was asked to pay for a new ticket. I piped up and said this wasn't fair and couldn't the conductor apply some common sense. No. If it were me I'd have made the common sense decision to ignore this missed rule and taken into account that the girl had actually checked this with East Coast and been mis-informed. The conductor didn't have this authority, nor it seemed really cared - maybe she deals with "chancers" all the time. What the young girl, who clearly isn't lying, has been able to do is provide here contact information so that she doesn't have to pay now and can appeal against the penalty later by post.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In our last ASP.NET post, <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2011/6/25/the-easiest-way-to-add-real-time-functionality-to-an-asp-net-e-commerce-application">The easiest way to add real-time functionality to an ASP.NET e-commerce application</a>, I demonstrated how to add realtime stock level updates and notifications to an ASP.NET e-commerce application. In this post I'm going to show how to add a "Who's shopping?" widget to the same application. The purpose of this widget is to show other users that interest in the product they are viewing is high and that, in combination with the realtime stock levels, will encourage them to make a purchase before the product sells out.</p>

<p>In this tutorial I'll show how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>subscribe to a presence channel</li>
<li>authenticate a subscription to a channel</li>
<li>provide Pusher with additional information about a user</li>
<li>display presence information on a product page for the "Who's shopping?" widget</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are desperate to see the demo in action you can see the <a href="http://realtimewebstore.apphb.com/">Real-Time Web Store demo here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pusher-presence"><a href="#pusher-presence">Pusher Presence</a></h2>
<p>To achieve the "Who's shopping?" functionality I'm going to be using a feature in Pusher called <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_channels#subscribe-presence-channels">presence</a>. Presence provides you with additional information about a channel you are subscribed to so that you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>who is subscribed to that channel</li>
<li>when new users subscribe</li>
<li>when existing users unsubscribe (by either actually unsubscribing or navigating away from the page).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to have a presence channel per product so that we know who is viewing each product.</p>
<h2 id="user-info-&amp;-authentication"><a href="#user-info-&amp;-authentication">User Info &amp; Authentication</a></h2>
<h3 id="subscribing-to-a-presence-channel"><a href="#subscribing-to-a-presence-channel">Subscribing to a presence channel</a></h3>
<p>You subscribe to a presence channel in the same way that you do to any other channel but the name of the channel must have a <code>presence-</code> prefix. Presence channels are normal channels with two additions; authentication and presence information. With this in mind we are just going to update our application to use a presence channel.</p>
<p>The JavaScript that makes the subscription in our Razor view looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>var productId = "@Model.ProductId";
var pusher = new Pusher("APP_KEY");
var channel = pusher.subscribe("presence-" + productId);
</code></pre>
<p>We also need to update the code in our <code>StoreController</code> to publish our stock events on the new presence channel:</p>
<pre><code>var stockEvent = new StockUpdatedEvent(model, socketId);
ObjectPusherRequest request = new ObjectPusherRequest("presence-" + stockEvent.ProductId, "stockUpdated", stockEvent);
_provider.Trigger(request);
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: If you are continuing where we left off in our last blog post there are a final couple of updates that are required to change the app to use the latest version of the Pusher JavaScript API. We recently released version 1.9 which introduced <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2011/7/12/connections-states">new connection state functionality</a> and also a new <code>connection</code> object. So, update your Pusher script tag as follows:</em></p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://js.pusherapp.com/1.9/pusher.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><em>And you'll also need to update any pieces of code that access the <code>socket_id</code> via the <code>Pusher</code> instance. It should now be accessed via the new <code>connection</code> object as follows:</em></p>
<pre><code>var socketId = pusher.connection.socket_id;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="getting-user-information"><a href="#getting-user-information">Getting User information</a></h3>
<p>If Pusher is to send events about users subscribing to and unsubscribing from presence channels it needs information about the users. It gets this information from your application when the subscription request to the channel is made (<code>pusher.subscribe('presence-channel')</code>). Since we can't really trust the web browser/client (it's so easy to hack JavaScript running in a web browser) the Pusher library requests this information from your web server by making an AJAX call. By default this call goes to <code>/pusher/auth</code> and passes two parameters; <code>channel_name</code>, which is the name of the channel being subscribed to, and <code>socket_id</code>, which is a unique identifier for the current user's connection to Pusher.</p>
<pre><code>/pusher/auth/?channel_name=presence-pusher-tshirt&amp;socket_id=&lt;unique_socket_id&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When our application responds to this request we must provide an authentication signature to confirm that the user can subscribe to the channel and, importantly for our "Who's shopping?" widget, information about the current user. The way we'll handle this within our ASP.NET MVC application is by creating a <code>PusherController</code> with an <code>Auth(string socket_id, string channel_name)</code> action, and by using the authentication functionality within the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-rest-dotnet">PusherRESTDotNet library</a>. This library is also available as a <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/PusherRESTDotNet">NuGet package</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you got the NuGet package as part of the last tutorial you'll need to update it since the authentication functionality has just been added. You should also check that the .NET 3.5 runtime version of Newtonsoft.Json is added.</em></p>
<h3 id="handling-the-authentication-request"><a href="#handling-the-authentication-request">Handling the authentication request</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the Pusher JavaScript library will make a request to <code>/pusher/auth</code> when making the authentication request. Our new <code>PusherController</code> with <code>Auth</code> action does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetches our Pusher credentials from the Web.config file.</li>
<li>Creates a new <code>PusherProvider</code> using the Pusher credentials</li>
<li>Creates a unique <code>user_id</code> for the presence channel</li>
<li>Creates an authentication string and returns that string as the <code>Content</code> of a <code>ContentResult' with the</code>ContentType<code>set to</code>application/json` in response to the AJAX request.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the moment this code doesn't do any user authentication or provide any additional information about the current user.</p>
<pre><code>using System;
using System.Configuration;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using PusherRESTDotNet;
using PusherRESTDotNet.Authentication;

namespace RealTimeWebStore.Controllers
{
    public class PusherController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Auth(string channel_name, string socket_id)
        {
            var applicationId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["application_id"];
            var applicationKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["application_key"];
            var applicationSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["application_secret"];

            var channelData = new PresenceChannelData()
            {
                user_id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
            };

            var provider = new PusherProvider(applicationId, applicationKey, applicationSecret);
            string authJson = provider.Authenticate(channel_name, socket_id, channelData);

            return new ContentResult { Content = authJson, ContentType = "application/json" };
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we use one of the many web browser development tools available to us to inspect the authentication call within the browser we'll see the JSON response coming back.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen+shot+2011-08-04+at+17" src="http://blog.pusher.com/media/2011/08/04/09/07/01/978/Screen+shot+2011-08-04+at+17.06.17.jpg?m=resize&amp;o%5Bgeometry%5D=500x400&amp;s=0d9d3c037a95e8d6" /></p>
<p>You'll see the response contains a <code>channel_data</code> property which itself has a <code>user_id</code> with a unique <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.guid.aspx"><code>Guid</code></a> value and a <code>user_info</code> property with a <code>null</code> value. Pusher uses this <code>user_id</code> value to uniquely identify the user subscription to the presence channel. So it's very important to make sure that each user has a unique ID.</p>
<h3 id="adding-authentication"><a href="#adding-authentication">Adding authentication</a></h3>
<p>We've mentioned authentication a few times but as yet we haven't authenticated the user. If the user has already logged (our app doesn't have this functionality, but most do) in we can use the existing <code>User.Identity</code> or else we can just assign a guest identity to the user. Once we have a unique ID for the user we'll also add some additional <code>user_info</code> to the <code>channelData</code>. The value of <code>user_info</code> can be anything you like from a simple string to a complex object. This gives you the ability to push as much additional information through Pusher and to the web page as you like. In our case we'll just send through a timestamp which identifies how long the user has been on the site.</p>
<pre><code>public ActionResult Auth(string channel_name, string socket_id)
{
    var channelData = new PresenceChannelData();
    if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        channelData.user_id = User.Identity.Name;
    }
    else
    {
        channelData.user_id = GetUniqueUserId();
    }
    channelData.user_info = GetUserInfo();

    var provider = new PusherProvider(applicationId, applicationKey, applicationSecret);
    string authJson = provider.Authenticate(channel_name, socket_id, channelData);

    return new ContentResult { Content = authJson, ContentType = "application/json" };
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: In our case we don't really need to authorise a user but in other situations where the user needs to be logged in we can return a 401  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.httpstatuscoderesult(v=vs.98).aspx?ppud=4"><code>HttpStatusCodeResult</code></a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="who's-shopping?"><a href="#who's-shopping?">Who's Shopping?</a></h2>
<p>Now that we've got a <code>PusherController</code> that gives Pusher information about the user, we can start showing information about the user on the product page. You can get information about the users subscribed to presence channels by binding to the <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_presence_events#pusher-subscription-succeeded"><code>pusher:subscription_succeeded</code></a> event on the presence channel object. The callback method for this event receives a <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_presence_events#members-parameter"><code>members</code></a> parameter which contains all the information about users subscribed to the channel.</p>
<p>First we'll create some HTML within our web page where we are going to show "Who's shopping?". Then we'll add the users to the HTML when pusher notifies us of them.</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="whos-shopping"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Who's shopping?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<pre><code>var pusher = new Pusher("006c79b1fe1700c6c10d");
var channel = pusher.subscribe("presence-" + productId);
channel.bind("pusher:subscription_succeeded", function(members) {

    members.each(function(member) {
        addMember(member);
    });

});

function addMember(member) {
    var enteredSite = new Date(member.info.timestamp);
    var now = new Date();
    var timeOnSite = (now - enteredSite);
    var li = $("&lt;li data-user-id='" + member.id + "'&gt;" +
                    member.id + " here for " +
                    toReadableTime(timeOnSite) +
               "&lt;/li&gt;");
    $(".whos-shopping ul").append(li);
};
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: The <code>members</code> object comes with a handy <code>each</code> method to make iterating the members collection really easy.</em></p>
<p>Of course new users can navigate to the page and existing users can leave it so the Pusher JavaScript library also exposes <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_presence_events#pusher-member-added"><code>pusher:member_added</code></a> and <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_presence_events#pusher-member-removed"><code>pusher:member_removed</code></a> events on the presence channel object. When these events fire we should add or remove the user as required.</p>
<pre><code>channel.bind("pusher:member_added", function(member) {
    addMember(member);
});
channel.bind("pusher:member_removed", function(member) {
    removeMember(member);
});

function addMember(member) {
    /* as before */
};

function removeMember(member) {
    $(".whos-shopping ul li[data-user-id='" + member.id + "']").remove();
};
</code></pre>
<p>With this in place we now have a fully functioning "Who's shopping?" widget that shows the current user who else is viewing the same product as they are.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen+shot+2011-08-03+at+21" src="http://blog.pusher.com/media/2011/08/03/13/19/53/544/Screen+shot+2011-08-03+at+21.10.42.jpg?m=resize&amp;o%5Bgeometry%5D=500x400&amp;s=ee8762b09260ca71" /></p>
<p>As mentioned in the opening paragraph, the theory here is that if shoppers can see that others users are viewing the same product it might give them that little push they need to take the plunge and make that purchase "while stocks last".</p>
<p>There are a few refinements and enhancements that could be made to this widget such as filtering out the current user from the "Who's shopping?" list or possibly showing them which one they are. You could also use the notification system from last time to notify the shopper when another shopper joins or leaves the product page. And, of course, you could add some user chat functionality to get the users discussing the product and really engaging. You could also have a staff member user who could answer any questions that the shoppers may have.</p>
<p>Just as last time all the code from this post is available in the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/realtime-webstore">real-time web store github repo</a>. You can also see the <a href="http://realtimewebstore.apphb.com/">Real-Time Web Store application up and running</a> on <a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHarbor</a>. I've tried to link to relevant parts of the <a href="http://pusher.com/docs">Pusher documentation</a> throughout the post but if there anything that isn't clear, if there's anything that I've not provided enough detail on and it all just seems too <em>'magical'</em>, then please leave a comment or send an email to me (<a href="mailto:phil@pusher.com?subject=ASP.NET%20real-time%20web%20store">phil@pusher.com</a>).</p>

<h2 id="addendum:-what-about-webforms?"><a href="#addendum:-what-about-webforms?">Addendum: What about WebForms?</a></h2>
<p>The post above shows how to user the Pusher REST .NET library within an ASP.NET MVC application but it can just as easily be used within an ASP.NET WebForms app. The way I achieved this was by adding a new Generic HTTP Handler to our web app which will handle the authentication AJAX call.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen+shot+2011-08-02+at+16" src="http://blog.pusher.com/media/2011/08/03/13/22/53/682/Screen+shot+2011-08-02+at+16.07.19.jpg?m=resize&amp;o%5Bgeometry%5D=500x400&amp;s=8b9774ad1cdd29ca" /></p>
<p>In the code below the <code>ProcessRequest</code> method does the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetches our Pusher credentials from the Web.config file.</li>
<li>Gets the values of the <code>channel_name</code> and <code>socket_id</code> parameters from the <code>context.Request</code></li>
<li>Creates a new <code>PusherProvider</code> using the Pusher credentials</li>
<li>Creates a unique <code>user_id</code> for the presence channel</li>
<li>Creates an authentication string and returns that string as the response body of the AJAX request.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the moment this code doesn't do any user authentication or provide any additional information about the current user.</p>
<pre><code>using System.Configuration;
using System.Web;
using PusherRESTDotNet;
using PusherRESTDotNet.Authentication;
using System;

namespace RealTimeWebStore
{
    public class AuthHandler : IHttpHandler
    {
        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
        {
            var applicationId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["pusher-application-id"];
            var applicationKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["pusher-application-key"];
            var applicationSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["pusher-application-secret"];

            var socketID = context.Request["socket_id"].ToString();
            var channelName = context.Request["channel_name"].ToString();
            var channelData = new PresenceChannelData()
            {
                user_id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
            };

            var provider = new PusherProvider(applicationId, applicationKey, applicationSecret);
            string authJson = provider.Authenticate(channelName, socketId,  channelData);

            context.Response.Write(authJson);
        }

        public bool IsReusable
        {
            get
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally we need to configure our handler in the application <code>Web.config</code> file. We want the <code>ProcessRequest</code> method of our handler to be invoked for any call to <code>/pusher/auth</code>. To do this we just add a handler to the <code>httpHandlers</code> element and specify our handler, <code>RealTimeWebStore.AuthHandler</code> as the handler:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;!-- other config --&gt;
  &lt;httpHandlers&gt;
    &lt;add verb="*"
         path="/pusher/auth/"
         type="RealTimeWebStore.AuthHandler" /&gt;
  &lt;/httpHandlers&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><script><br />
var div = $("
<div/>")<br />
.css({<br />
"text-align":"center",<br />
"margin":"auto",<br />
"margin-bottom":"10px"<br />
});<br />
$(".entrybody img")<br />
.css({<br />
"-moz-border-radius": "4px",<br />
"-webkit-border-radius": "4px",<br />
"-o-border-radius": "4px",<br />
"-ms-border-radius": "4px",<br />
"-khtml-border-radius": "4px",<br />
"border-radius": "4px",<br />
"border": "1px solid #DEDEDE",<br />
"padding": "4px"})<br />
.wrap(div);<br />
</script></p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.pusherapp.com/2011/6/25/the-easiest-way-to-add-real-time-functionality-to-an-asp-net-e-commerce-application</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>While adding realtime functionality to ASP.NET applications has often seemed difficult due to the connection limitations of the IIS platform, it can actually be achieved fairly easily by offloading this component to third party services like Pusher. In this series of posts, I'll get you started with this exciting technology through a number of hands-on tutorials. In the first one we'll build a simple e-commerce application that displays realtime stock levels to the customers.</p>
<p>One of the problems with existing e-commerce solutions can be trying to buy something which, whilst you've been online, has sold out. This can be a big problem for high demand products like gig tickets or sporting events such as the Olympics. A really good way of avoiding this is to show the customers just how fast tickets are selling. The added benefit of this, from a business point of view, is that it can give users that little push they needed to make that purchase. In this tutorial I'll show how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish a connection to Pusher in the view</li>
<li>subscribe to a product channel</li>
<li>bind events from this channel to our stock indicator in the view and update the stock level</li>
<li>send stock level update from our server when someone buys something</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started"><a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></h2>
<p>To demonstrate adding real-time functionality to an ASP.NET website I'm going to start with a simple one page e-commerce site which has one product: our cool Pusher t-shirt (Sorry, they're not really for sale. You've got to earn them!). On the product page there is a counter which tells the customer how many t-shirts we have in stock.</p>
<div style="margin:auto; text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px;"><img alt="One-browser" src="http://blog.pusher.com/media/2011/06/27/05/04/29/40/one-browser.jpg?m=resize&amp;o%5Bgeometry%5D=600x300&amp;s=413d474f960a2e7c" /></div>
<p>To start off with our e-commerce website is a simple ASP.NET MVC3 app with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>StoreController</code> with two actions. One to display the default view and one to handle the "Buy" button being clicked and the stock level being decreased.</li>
<li>A single <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx">Razor</a> view displaying the single product</li>
<li>Two models; one for the product called <code>ProductModel</code> and one for images called <code>ProductImage</code></li>
<li>A <code>ProductRepository</code> where we store our products</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connect-to-pusher"><a href="#connect-to-pusher">Connect to Pusher</a></h2>
<p>As I've already said, adding real-time functionality is really simple - that's the point! Firstly we have to include the Pusher JavaScript client library. We'll add this to the view for the moment although we might want to make the include part of the site layout in the future.</p>
<p><em>Note: If your e-commerce page was being served up over HTTPS you would include our library over HTTPS too to avoid any browser warnings.</em></p>
<p>Since we are using ASP.NET MVC we've already got jQuery included from the <code>_Layout.cs.html</code> so we can wait until the page has loaded and connect to Pusher. The script include and the code that connects to Pusher looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://js.pusherapp.com/1.8/pusher.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    $(function() {
        var pusher = new Pusher("006c79b1fe1700c6c10d");
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="subscribe-to-the-product-channel"><a href="#subscribe-to-the-product-channel">Subscribe to the product channel</a></h2>
<p>Now that we've connected to Pusher we can push events from our StoreController to all connected browsers if any information changes about the product. The main piece of information that customers might want to know about is if the stock level changes. These t-shirts could sell out fast!</p>
<p>We need to choose a channel name to subscribe and publish to and the obvious choice is to use the unique product id for this. We'll also prefix it with <code>product-</code> just so it's really clear that the channels is for a product. We subscribe to this channel on the client as follows getting the product id from the Model that has been bound to the page:</p>
<pre><code>var channel = pusher.subscribe("product-@Model.ProductId");
</code></pre>
<h2 id="bind-to-stock-update-events"><a href="#bind-to-stock-update-events">Bind to stock update events</a></h2>
<p>Once we've got a channel object we can bind to events on it. We want to be informed when the stock level changes so let's bind to an event called <code>stockUpdated</code>. We'll also expect a JSON object to be passed which represents the <code>ProductModel</code> and will have the same properties on it. That way we can simply update the stock level in the page to match the value on the server by accessing the <code>ProductModel.StockLevel</code> value. We can also update the stock status:</p>
<pre><code>channel.bind("stockUpdated", function(product) {
    $(".product .stock .level").html(product.StockLevel);
    $(".product .stock .status").html(product.StockStatus);
});
</code></pre>
<h2 id="trigger-stock-update-events"><a href="#trigger-stock-update-events">Trigger stock update events</a></h2>
<p>As you can see, this is really easy to do. It's just as easy to trigger the event on the server too. To do this we're going to be using the <a href="https://github.com/grahamscott/pusherrestdotnet">C# REST API library</a> within our <code>StoreController</code>. You can get the PusherRESTDotNet library from <a href="https://github.com/grahamscott/pusherrestdotnet">github</a> or <a href="http://nuget.org/Package/Edit/PusherRESTDotNet/1.0">via NugGet</a>.</p>
<div style="margin:auto;text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px;"><a href="http://nuget.org/Package/Edit/PusherRESTDotNet/1.0"><img alt="Pusher-rest-library-nuget" src="http://blog.pusher.com/media/2011/06/25/14/08/10/392/pusher-rest-library-nuget.jpg?m=resize&amp;o%5Bgeometry%5D=600x300&amp;s=837c6fbf2f053537" /></a></div>
<p>Once we've added our PusherRESTDotNet reference we can add a few lines of code to our <code>StoreController</code> to instantly push any changes in stock level to all connected web browsers viewing our t-shirt page.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to create a <code>PusherProvider</code> and pass in our Pusher details. In this example we are storing these details in the ASP.NET MVC3 <code>Web.config</code>.</p>
<h3 id="web.config"><a href="#web.config">Web.config</a></h3>
<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;appSettings&gt;
    &lt;add key="application_id" value="APP_ID" /&gt;
    &lt;add key="application_key" value="APP_KEY" /&gt;
    &lt;add key="application_secret" value="APP_SECRET" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- more settings --&gt;
  &lt;/appSettings&gt;

  &lt;!-- more config --&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="storecontroller.cs"><a href="#storecontroller.cs">StoreController.cs</a></h3>
<pre><code>public class StoreController : Controller
{
  private IPusherProvider _provider;

  public StoreController()
  {
      string applicationKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["application_key"];
      string applicaitonSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["application_secret"];
      string applicationId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["application_id"];
      _provider = new PusherProvider(applicationId, applicationKey, applicaitonSecret);
  }

  // more code here...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once we've created our instance of the <code>PusherProvider</code> we can create a <code>PusherObjectRequest</code> to push the <code>ProductModel</code>, with an updated <code>StockLevel</code> following the purchase, to the clients. The serialisation of the model object is handled for us by the PusherRESTDotNet library. The full <code>StoreController.Index</code> HTTP POST handling action looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Index()
{
  bool bought = MvcApplication.ProductRepository.Buy(MvcApplication.BLUE_TSHIRT_ID);
  var model = MvcApplication.ProductRepository.GetProductById(MvcApplication.BLUE_TSHIRT_ID);

  if (bought)
  {
      ViewBag.Info = model.Title + " successfully bought";

      ObjectPusherRequest request = new ObjectPusherRequest("product-" + model.ProductId, "stockUpdated", model);
      _provider.Trigger(request);
  }
  else
  {
      ViewBag.Error = "There was a problem buying " + model.Title;
  }

  return View("Index", model);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you run your application and open two or more windows, as soon as a user in one window clicks the "Buy" button you'll see that the stock level value instantly updates in all other windows.</p>
<div style="margin:auto; text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px;"><iframe src="http://www.screenr.com/embed/kfNs" width="600" height="366" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
<small><em>Note: the video looks a little jittery because it was recorded on a VM running on Mac</em></small></div>
<p>&lt;h2 id=”next-time—displaying-real-time-“who’s-shopping”-info-with-pusher-presence”&gt;&lt;a href=”#next-time—displaying-real-time-“who’s-shopping”-info-with-pusher-presence”&gt;Next time - displaying real-time “Who’s shopping” info with Pusher presence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>We now have the stock level indicator changing in real-time. This tells the users that these t-shirts are selling out fast and gives them an added incentive to make that impulse buy. This is a simple yet effective change but there's more we can do. What if we also show the user how many other users are viewing that product at the same time so that they know there is competition for the last few t-shirts? We can do that easily using Pusher's <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/presence">presence</a> functionality and I'll cover that in my next <strong>Real-Time ASP.NET</strong> blog post which will also go into how to add Pusher <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users">user authentication</a> to your ASP.NET web application.</p>
<p>In the meantime you can download the source of the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/realtime-webstore">Real-Time Web Store from github</a>. The solution contains a project with the basic web store without any real-time Pusher functionality as well as a solution project. Here are some additional things you you might also want to try out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the form submission when the user clicks "Buy" so that the <code>POST</code> to the <code>Buy</code> action it is made using a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/">jQuery ajax call</a></li>
<li>Making the change in stock levels more visually interesting. Try adding an <a href="http://jqueryui.com/docs/effect/">effect</a> to the number change or providing a <a href="http://webtoolkit4.me/2009/08/13/jquery-growl-likenotification-systems/">growl-like notification</a></li>
<li>Changing the CSS - it's not my strong point :-)</li>
</ul>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/start.png"></a>I <a href="/2011/05/21/goodbye-kwwika-hello-pusher.html">joined Pusher</a> around over a month ago now and it's been a non-stop whirlwind of activity. On my first day I was in Poland at <a href="/2011/05/24/notes-on-falsy-values.html">Falsy Values</a> for a JavaScript conference and at the same time I was putting together an article for <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/">.net magazine</a>. The article is now in the August edition (issue 217) and it got a massive 5 page spread (must be all the pictures).</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/homepage.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-20598" title=".net magazine issue 227 (August)" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/homepage-241x300.png" alt="" width="241" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>The article covers building a real-time survey using Ruby on Rails and <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>. I also wrote about how Pusher can be used to progressively enhance an application in the way that has been touted as a "best practice" approach when adding JavaScript to a web application. I won't got into any more detail, if you are interested you can <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/august-2011-217">pick up a copy</a> :) I bought one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/start.png"><img class="aligncenter" title="start" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/start.png" alt="" width="617" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>This is a really big achievement for me and for Pusher, so I'd like to thank the guys at Pusher for taking me on and also for giving me the opportunity to write the article. It showed a lot of confidence in my ability from day one and that means a lot. Maybe it was a test? ;)</p>
<div>
<p>[caption id="attachment_20600" align="aligncenter" width="694" caption="Mugshot"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/end.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-20600" title="end" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/end.png" alt="" width="694" height="231" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I'll keep this short as I don't want to make it too much of a "look at me" post. I just want to post something as a "record of achievement" of something I'm proud of and as a thanks to the guys as Pusher.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Collecta Gets Dispensed: Was It Solving a Hard Enough Problem?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/collecta-gets-dispensed-were-they-solving-a-hard-enough-problem/</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/collecta-gets-dispensed-were-they-solving-a-hard-enough-problem/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/collecta"><img src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at1703.png" alt="Collecta" class="imgRight" /></a>At the beginning of 2011 we reported that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/24/collecta-drops-its-real-time-search-api/">Collect had decided to drop it&#8217;s API</a> in order to change their offering to something more profitable. But now ReadWriteWeb have reported <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_lights_go_out_at_collecta_real_time_search.php">the disappointing demise of Collecta</a>. This has the potential of being the first big failure of a well funded real-time web focused company, so questions need to be asked about why this happened and why Collecta weren&#8217;t successful. Back in January of this year we asked &#8220;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/25/is-it-finally-the-end-for-real-time-search-engines/">Is It Finally the End for Real-time Search Engines?&#8221;</a> and it now looks like that very question is being raised again.</p>
<p>A very important question, that I recently heard from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/roanlavery">Roan Laverly</a> of <a href="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/">FreeAgent</a>: &#8220;Is your product solving a hard enough problem?&#8221; Well, what problems was Collecta solving?</p>
<p><a href="http://collecta.com"><img style="vertical-align: middle; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/collecta1.png" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a></p>
<p>The first problem Collecta was solving was search, and the problem with building a search product in general is that the market is massively dominated by Google. Even Microsoft&#8217;s Bing and Yahoo! can&#8217;t really make a significant dent in the search market, so how can anybody compete? Collecta tried to compete by using real-time search results as their unique selling point &#8211; Google now has a real-time search option, and if a topic is trending real-time search results can form part of the general search results too.</p>
<p>Another problem that Collecta was solving was making real-time data accessible. So many companies that have real-time data are now opening up their own APIs and increasing the ease at which anybody can access that data. This means individuals and companies can now got direct to source and build their own search offering, or just extract just the data they need themselves. I&#8217;m quite sure that Collecta has some very clever technology that delivered their best guess (algorithmically computed) search results in real-time. But again, it doesn&#8217;t sound like that was enough.</p>
<p>Creating real-time technology components capable of consuming, processing and distributing large amounts of data was another problem that Collecta had to answer. Initially building the technology capable of doing this was difficult but now, a few years later, real-time technology components are much more widely accessible. So whilst the difficulty level is still high the problem isn&#8217;t as difficult as it once was. This in itself has meant that data companies can build their own APIs.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the problem of creating a compelling application and products. A website showing real-time search results in a intuitive and informative way. Widgets showing search results in an easy to digest and embeddable format. The post on ReadWriteWeb provides a comment by one of their own writers, Jared Smith, on Collecta&#8217;s applications:</p>
<blockquote><p>Collecta&#8217;s emphasis on a search experience that went beyond Twitter into photos and videos made it a great tool to truly watch a story unfold in real time. Their embeddable widget, which I used regularly on ReadWriteWeb&#8217;s event sites, was far more powerful than what Twitter provided and is still unmatched in my mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, even though they were building a useful products it wasn&#8217;t enough. Did Jared pay for the widget, and if not would he have been willing to? Would enough users have been willing to pay?</p>
<p>The good news out of all of this is that it sounds like the Collecta technology is going to be open sourced. A quote on the ReadWriteWeb post states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Collecta now says it will open source its software and is working with a variety of organizations to do so &#8211; including United Nations crisis relief projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the real-time search problem hard enough? We should keep our eyes on <a href="http://topsy.com/">Topsy</a> and <a href="http://www.socialmention.com/">Social Mention</a> to see how they get on. What we can be sure of though is that with Collecta open sourcing their technology the real-time search technology question will now be easier than ever to answer.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Notes on Falsy Values]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/05/24/notes-on-falsy-values.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/05/24/notes-on-falsy-values.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I spent the majority of last week in Warsaw at <a href="http://falsyvalues.com">Falsy Values</a> where I attended a Games Workshop and a conference day. It was also my first week working as a Developer Evangelist working for <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>. A big and exciting week all round.</p>

<h3 id="html5-games-workshop"><a href="#html5-games-workshop">HTML5 Games Workshop</a></h3>
<p>The HTML5 games workshop was ran by <a href="http://twitter.com/kuvos">@kuvos</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pornelski">@pornelski</a> and we went through building a game of Tetris and then <a href="http://qfox.nl/weblog/232">Mario</a>. I was very impressed to see what can be achieved with Canvas and the workshop provided a lot of food for thought about the sorts of things that would be really useful to HTML5 games developers. Watch this space, and the <a href="http://blog.pusherapp.com/2011/5/22/pusher-at-falsy-values">Pusher blog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-keynote"><a href="#the-keynote">The Keynote</a></h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pusher_crockford.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16127" title="Douglas Crockford at Falsy Values - and a Pusher banner!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pusher_crockford-225x300.jpg" alt="Douglas Crockford at Falsy Values - and a Pusher banner!" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The morning of the conference day saw a few fuzzy heads from the Pusher party the night before, but they soon cleared as <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a> delivered the keynote. He covered the good and bad parts of JavaScript and how, as developers, we need to us a combination of head and gut (instinct) when writing code. <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> got a number of mentions and Douglas stressed the importance of following coding practices. He explained that just because JavaScript lets us do something, it doesn’t mean we should necessarily do it.  Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<h4 id="always-use-treble-equals-for-comparisons"><a href="#always-use-treble-equals-for-comparisons">Always use treble equals for comparisons</a></h4>

<pre><code class="language-js">if(myVar === 0) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Many of us already know that double equals can lead to problems. 0 compared with an empty string will evaluate to try, undefined compared with null will evaluate to true and a number of no so obvious examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">'0' == 0 // true
'00' == false // true
true == 1 // true
undefined == null // true
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore Douglas believes it’s best practice to always use treble equals so that the code intent is absolutely clear.</p>

<h4 id="put-curly-brackets-after-parenthesis"><a href="#put-curly-brackets-after-parenthesis">Put curly brackets after parenthesis</a></h4>

<pre><code class="language-js">function myFunc() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>This was a hard one to swallow as I like to put my parenthesis on the left - on the next line. However, Douglas provided an example which made me realise that it could be a bad thing.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">function buildObjectLiteral()
{
   return // this returns!
   {
      'someProperty': '&amp;quot;'hello'
   };
}
</code></pre>

<p>The interesting thing here is that undefined will be returned because a line break is also ends a statement in JavaScript. I don’t think I would actually ever do this. I would probably assign the object literal to a variable first and then return it. However, if I didn’t follow this rule I might make the above mistake. If it can happen then the easiest way to avoid it is just don’t do it. So, curly brackets now go on the same line – on the right.</p>
<h3 id="do-the-right-thing"><a href="#do-the-right-thing">Do the right thing</a></h3>
<p>Douglas explained that he has made some changes to his coding practices recently. A developer had contacted him asking if JSLint should report a problem if it found a switch statement that allowed any code to fall through between cases. Although he had a gut feeling that it was probably not a good thing to do he believed that it would “hardly ever” cause a problem. Some time later the developer got back to Douglas saying he’d found a bug in JSLint. The bug was causes by a switch statement which allowed code to fall through cases. Doug has now formed the opinion that if something can cause a problem, even if it’s unlikely, that the best practice is don’t do it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">switch(test)  {
   case 0:
      // don’t do it!
   case 1:
      break;
   case 2:
      break;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="when-will-ecmascript-6-reach-the-web-browser?"><a href="#when-will-ecmascript-6-reach-the-web-browser?">When will ECMAScript 6 reach the web browser?</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/dmitrysoshnikov">Dmitry Soshnikov</a> gave a talk on <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php">ECMAScript 6</a>, codename Harmony. Whilst there seem like some good ideas going to to ES6 the question remains when will anybody actually be able to use it in a web browser? It will probably a be available in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> before it's most browser runtimes. It also sounded like a lot of syntactical things were being drawn from Erlang - not sure about this.</p>
<p>Slides: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmitrysoshnikov/falsyvalues-dmitry-soshnikov-ecmascript-6">http://www.slideshare.net/dmitrysoshnikov/falsyvalues-dmitry-soshnikov-ecmascript-6</a></p>
<h3 id="fabric.js---the-new-defacto-js-library-for-canvas?"><a href="#fabric.js---the-new-defacto-js-library-for-canvas?">Fabric.js - the new defacto JS Library for Canvas?</a></h3>
<p>I didn't sit through this talk as I had to pop out and get some work done and thought my tapping on a keyboard would annoy those around me. However, whilst in the games workshop it was very clear that it's unlikely that people would be accessing the Canvas API directly and that, in the same way that very few people use document.getElementById, very few people will directly call canvas.getContext("2d") - they use a library that offers richer functionality to the developer. <a href="http://kangax.github.com/fabric.js/test/demo/">Fabric.js</a> provides exactly that.</p>
<p>The talk was given by <a href="twitter.com/kangax">Juriy "kangax" Zaytsev</a> on Fabric.js and you can check out the demos from here:<br />
<a href="http://kangax.github.com/fabric.js/test/demo/">http://kangax.github.com/fabric.js/test/demo/</a></p>
<h3 id="javascript-jit"><a href="#javascript-jit">JavaScript JIT</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/zbraniecki">Zbigniew Braniecki</a> of Mozilla gave a really interesting talk about JavaScript engine Just-in-time compilation methods. There are two types of compilation, method and tracing. Here's how I understand they work. Method counts the number of times a method is called and if it reaches a certain number of calls then the method is compiled (no longer interpreted). Tracing analysis code paths and compiles code paths that are commonly executed. Apparently there is very little documentation on this and Zbigniew had to do a lot of work to find out which methods each browser uses and to come up with the slides.</p>
<p>The point of his talk was that we can actually help compilers make our apps faster by writing code with the compilers in mind. In most cases this won't be necessary but if you are trying to squeeze that extra bit of performance out of your app it's something you might consider.</p>
<p>Slides: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zbraniecki/js-compilation-falsy-values-slides">http://www.slideshare.net/zbraniecki/js-compilation-falsy-values-slides</a></p>
<h3 id="phonegap"><a href="#phonegap">PhoneGap</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately I missed this one but it was delivered by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/BrianLeRoux">Brian LeRoux</a> and he demonstrated how to build an app in PhoneGap. Go check out <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, it sounds super useful.</p>
<h3 id="has-javascript-won?"><a href="#has-javascript-won?">Has JavaScript won?</a></h3>
<p>There were two other presentations, first <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/sh1mmer">Tom Hughes-Croucher</a> on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, who also ran the node.js workshop on the first two days, and finally <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/t">Tantek Çelik</a> talking about his new project <a href="http://tantek.pbworks.com/w/page/19402872/CassisProject">CASSIS</a> which defines a sub-set of JavaScript which can run both in JavaScript and PHP. As I mention in my post about Falsy Values on the Pusher blog, right now is a great time to be a JavaScript developer. You can now developer server applications, in the browser, for mobile devices and also for the desktop.</p>
<p>It's really strange to think that in 2004 I left a job because I was doing purely JavaScript and I wasn't sure the language was going anywhere. How wrong was I? :)</p>
<p>Finally, a big thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/czerskip">Pawe? Czerski</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/varjs">Damian Wielgosik</a> who organised Falsy Values. Well done guys!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you follow <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter">me on Twitter</a> or if I've met up with you in the past few weeks you'll probably know, or have guessed the news. I'm leaving Kwwika, and have joined <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>. Whilst it's disappointing to leave a project that I've spent the last one year and three months on behind, the move to Pusher couldn't have happened without it.</p>

<p>My new role as Developer Evangelist at Pusher is the type of role that I've been trying to build for myself for a long time and it's fantastic that <a href="http://twitter.com/maxthelion">Max</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dctanner">Damien</a> at Pusher have given me this opportunity. The days that I've enjoyed most over the past year and a bit have been the days when I've been working with others, interacting online, attending events, writing blog posts to gauge opinion and share ideas, and learning from others. This is exactly what I'll be doing in my new job. Awesome!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-15640" title="Me with co-founder of Pusher, Damien Tanner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/damien_phil_pusher-300x224.jpg" alt="Phil Leggetter with co-founder of Pusher, Damien Tanner" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-pusher?"><a href="#what-is-pusher?">What is Pusher?</a></h3>
<p>Pusher is a hosted HTML5 WebSockets service that makes it possible to quickly, easily and securely add real-time functionality to any web, mobile or desktop application (anything connected to the Internet). This sort of thing is ideally suited to collaboration and communication apps, multiplayer games, real-time dashboards, social media integration, real-time messaging and a whole range of applications that have yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>Please drop me an <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=Goodbye%20Kwwika,%20Hello%20Pusher%21">email</a> or send me a <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter">tweet</a> if you have any questions at all.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=19415</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=19415</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/guzzle-ayup"><img src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at3641.png" alt="Guzzle Ayup!" class="imgRight" /></a>PubSubHubbub has become the standard protocol for real-time RSS and Atom feed subscription and delivery. But not everybody wants to host their own PubSubHubbub hub in the same way that hardly anybody hosts their own website, and why cloud services in general have become so popular. <a href="http://ayup.us/">Guzzle Ayup</a> has entered the market to offer a hosted PubSubHubbub hub service.</p>
<p>Since PubSubHubbub has been around for a while it’s relatively easy for a developer to start using a hub such as Guzzle Ayup (Ayup for short). There are a good number of PubSubHubbub <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/wiki/PublisherClients">publisher</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/wiki/SubscriberClients">subscriber</a> clients that can be used. There is also a reasonable amount of documentation on the subject including the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">Google PubSubHubbub home page</a> and <a href="https://ayup.us/documentation">Ayup’s documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Ayup was created by a web agency based in Paris called <a href="http://lemonchik.com/">Lemonchik</a> following the requirement to provide notifications to a real-time theme-based news aggregator called <a href="http://guzzle.it/">Guzzle</a> and for future web and iOS applications that will require real-time notifications. They were so happy with the final implementation that they decided to build a front-end console and offer it as a public service.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19418" title="Ayup User Dashboard - Add a feed" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/ayup_dashboard-266x300.png" alt="" width="266" height="300" /></p>
<p>Marca Tatem of Lemonchik (and Guzzle Ayup) explains a bit more about the internals of the the service:</p>
<blockquote><p>The internals of Ayup are fun to look at. It&#8217;s a ruby application with a Sinatra web-service, and everything is happening in high-performance, RAM only, Resque queues (backed with Redis). Ayup structure is in itself completely scalable, adding a server with hundreds of new workers is a matter of minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ayup offer a simple pay for what you use pricing policy and allow you to set a notification limit which can be handy in keeping costs down when subscribed feeds update more than expected. They also offer something called Virtual hubs which Marca explains as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Virtual Hubs are PubSubHubbub hubs content publishers can create to push free notifications to subscribers. For example, let&#8217;s say that you want people to be able to receive instant push notifications each time you publish a story, you simply create a virtual hub ([YourHubName].ayup.us) people can subscribe to (with a subscribe request) and notifications will be sent to their http callback for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marca continues to explain why Virtual Hubs are a good way of encouraging simple and free access to your content:</p>
<blockquote><p>The difference between a virtual hub and the actual ayup&#8217;s hub is that with a virtual hub, you can only send a subscribe request for a topic that belongs to the virtual hub&#8217;s owner. In other words, if you create a virtual hub, I can&#8217;t send a subscribe request for MacRumor&#8217;s RSS feed. If I want to subscribe to many different feeds without limitations, then I&#8217;ll have to create an Ayup account and pay for sent notifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ayup’s focus for the near future is to keep things simple by delivering a good experience for developers and good quality of service such as fast and constant notifications and clean ATOM.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are only two hosted PubSubHubbub hub services (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/wiki/Hubs">Hub implementations and hosted services</a>). The first well-known service <a href="http://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> and now there is the welcome addition of a second in <a href="http://ayup.us/">Guzzle Ayup</a></p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/05/12/dundee-web-standards-fleet-collective-and-browser-warfare.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of nights ago I want to a <a href="http://www.dundeewebstandards.com/">Dundee Web Standards</a> event. The events are organised by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/leckie">Chris Leckie</a> and has been running since around October 2010. I've attended once before to see <a href="http://dev.opera.com/author/974138">Chris Mills of Opera</a> give a talk on HTML 5 so this was only my second time at a DWS event which is held once a month at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?ie=UTF8&amp;q=braes+dundee&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=braes&amp;hnear=Dundee,+Dundee+City&amp;cid=16707175756212399315&amp;z=14">Braes, Perth Road, Dundee</a>.</p>

<div><a href="http://dundeewebstandards.com/"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dundeewebstandards.png" alt="" width="200" height="104" /></a></div>

<h2 id="the-fleet-collective"><a href="#the-fleet-collective">The Fleet Collective</a></h2>
<p>Most of us will have heard of <a href="http://www.techhub.com/">TechHub</a> (and variations) and have an idea about what it is; it's a place where you can rent a desk(s), use office facilities and because there will be other like-minded people about the atmosphere will hopefully inspiring and creative. There will also be the opportunity to network and potentially collaborate on projects and potentially reach larger clients that you would on your own.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.fleetcollective.com/"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fleetcollective.png" alt="" width="234" height="232" /></a></div>
<p>Whilst TechHub is obviously concentrating on "tech" the <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/fleetcollective">Fleet Collective</a> are actively looking for a wider range of individuals to take up residence or hire a desk for the day. It has been founded by a guy going by the name of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sooperdd?sk=info">Sooper Double D</a> and a partner (I didn't catch her name) who have drawn inspiration from a number of similar ventures in places such as the Netherlands (I didn't take a note of the names - sorry). The Fleet Collective will be based in what looks like a fantastic old building, which is presently under renovation, right in the centre of Dundee.</p>
<p>I've lived near Dundee for just over a year now and can clearly see that it has a massive potential to have a fantastic tech community (maybe it does already and I've just not been out enough). Whilst the government and the council have focused on the games industry in recently years, mainly due to the presence and apparent success of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realtime_Worlds">Real-Time Worlds</a>, I would hope that this is going to change to be a focus on Dundee as a technology community. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-11003456">demise of Real-Time Worlds</a> may end up being a blessing in disguise as there will no longer be one big company dominating the scene and all tech communities, from all industries (game, web, manufacturing, healthcare, finance) now have an opportunity to work together. Combine this with the Fleet Collectives aim of trying mix all types of creative focus (print, art, tech) I really think this is a fantastic opportunity and a great initiative.</p>
<p>For more information check out The <a href="http://www.fleetcollective.com/">Fleet Collective website</a> (under construction), the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/fleetcollective">Fleet Collective Facebook page</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/fleetcollective">@fleetcollective</a> on Twitter.</p>
<h2 id="browser-warfare"><a href="#browser-warfare">Browser Warfare</a></h2>
<p>I've been working with browser technologies since I was at University, my final year project was a JavaScript intensive project (IMHO it was actually rubbish, but a good learning experience), and my first job was at Caplin Systems as a Software Engineer building APIs and web frameworks using JavaScript. During this time the runtime environment for all the JavaScript APIs and apps was of course the web browser, so I was very interested to hear what Chris Leckie's talk on browser warfare would cover.</p>
<p>Chris spoke about browser fragmentation - how different browsers behave in different ways give the same code (HTML, JavaScript, CSS). The way each browser may render pages differently. From layout to even font rendering on Windows and Mac, each web browser really can be a different animal. Chris explained his opinion that it was up to us to try and make sure our apps and websites look the same in all browsers and that sometimes it can just be a matter of checking our own code first before blaming the browser.</p>
<p>And, of course, we covered the dreaded beast that is IE6.</p>
<p>What I really liked about Chris' talk is that he wasn't really there to answer all the questions. He gave his talk to encourage discussion and it definitely worked. The discussion session afterwards went on for quite some time covering why IE6 got into the situation it was, what we can do to encourage the death of IE6, whether it's clients who specify the browsers their app or website must run or if it's the dev or design companies and are any of the current crop of browsers going to increase the fragmentation.</p>
<p>After all that there was a chance to have a chat with others there and it certainly seems that web design, web development and manufacturing companies are represented at the event. I don't know if any games companies were though?</p>
<h2 id="next"><a href="#next">Next</a></h2>
<p>Dundee Web Standards seems to be going from strength to strength and next month a Microsoft Developer Evangelist will be giving a talk on IE10. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/dundeewebstands">@DundeeWebStands</a> (pesky Twitters screen name limit) and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dundeewebstandards">Dundee Web Standards Facebook page</a> for the announcement.</p>
<h2 id="the-highland-fling"><a href="#the-highland-fling">The Highland Fling</a></h2>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that there is a full day tech event coming up in Edinburgh called <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/">The Highland Fling</a> which has some really good speakers going to it.</p>
<div><a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/thehighlandfling.png" alt="" width="244" height="243" /></a></div>

      <title><![CDATA[DDD Scotland 2011 - Maybe .NET developers aren't scared of the tech community]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/05/09/ddd-scotland-2011.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/05/09/ddd-scotland-2011.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday I went to DDD Scotland for the first time and really enjoyed myself. Not only were there some really good talks on a range of subjects but the it was great to meet people I interact with on Twitter and make new connections. I managed my schedule for the day using a <a href="http://ddd.thededicateddeveloper.com/">mobile app created for DDD Scotland</a> by the recently formed <a href="http://www.thisislevelup.com/">Level Up</a>.</p>

<div><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ddd_logo.png" alt="" width="229" height="91" /></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Schedule.aspx">DDD Scotland schedule</a> covered a number of interesting topics and I decided to jump between the tracks to try and get a bit of everything. I started off with <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=662">From .NET to Rail</a>s by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/colin_gemmell">Colin Gemmell</a> which is particularly interesting to me since just the other day I tackled my first Ruby on Rails application and even wrote up a small <a href="http://leggetter.posterous.com/installing-a-ruby-on-rails-development-enviro">blog post</a> on my findings. Colin's enthusiasm is second to none and it was really interesting to hear that he finds himself to be more productive writing rails applications using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> than he was building ASP.NET websites.</p>
<p>The second session I went to was<a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=707"> Building seriously scalable websites with ASP.NET</a> with and without Windows by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/chrishayuk">Chris Hay</a>. My reasoning behind attending this session was two-fold; I've met Chris briefly for a coffee around a month ago so wanted to make sure I caught up with him again and I've also been trying to build an IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) product using a combination of Microsoft and non-MS components (Kwwika). I think <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/leggetter/status/66814414787051520">my tweet about the session</a> pretty much sums things up.</p>
<blockquote><p>.@chrishayuk is nuts, knows his stuff, is a bit disorganised, uses cool tech &amp; I have a lot more knowledge on scaling than I did 1 hour ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>I actually knew that Chris had been still putting the presentation together late in to the night before and was even updating things 10 minutes before the session started so the tweet was a bit "tongue in cheek". The main thing was that in everything that Chris did there was a glimpse of another new exciting technology combined with some proven ones; <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodeJS</a>, <a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a>, <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> and <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> all got a mention along with CDNs, ASP.NET, IIS, Amazon EC2 and much more. He also covered techniques that can be used to speed up servers and page load times. Chris mentioned that he will be writing a book on the subjects he covered - where's the pre-order link? :)</p>
<p>I then sat in on two Grok talks. The first was by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/aaronbassett">Aaron Bassett</a> of <a href="http://www.thisislevelup.com/">Level Up</a> delivering 20 Django hints and tips in just 10 minutes. Wow! The second was a thought-provoking grok by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/roblally">Rob Lally</a> (asked to come up with the talk only a few hours beforehand). Rob showed three ways of social interaction to try and achieve the same goal (I wished I had a video recorder) and then went on to discuss how we need to consider how we interact with others in order to achieve goals - with an emphasis on ensuring the goal, and the reason behind it, must be understood.</p>
<p>DDD Scotland also introduced an alternative track so I decided to give that a go next. <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/markrendle">Mark Rendle</a> gave a talk on <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=656">How to Manage Your Manager</a> (future managers beware ;)). He explained that managers and developers can be two very different animals but for them to get on they each need to understand how the other works and understand the driving factors behind their decisions. He covered things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_shadowing">shadowing</a>, how to convince your manager that better hardware and software (e.g. faster computers, a 2nd monitor, productivity tools like <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>) can improve your productivity and benefit them and general communication tips. I wish I'd known some of those tips about a year ago: for example, ask for a "respond by" date when sending an email and set appointments in your managers calendar as they really are calendar driven and without the calendar to prompt them they can easily forget (as I've found).</p>
<p>Then I attended a session on <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=697">SpecFlow - functional testing made easy</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72">Paul Stack</a>. This covered what BDD was and Paul explained why he had moved away from TDD. He then focused on showing how <a href="http://www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> made BDD, well, easy. Paul also demonstrated how <a href="http://watin.org/">WatiN</a> can be used to write an acceptance framework for your application driven by specifications written in SpecFlow.</p>
<p>The final session I attended was another alternative track one called Ask the Speakers. This gave me the opportunity to raise my <a href="/2011/04/28/are-net-developers-scared-of-the-tech-community-and-cutting-edge-technologies.html">Are .NET developers scared of the tech community and cutting edge technologies?</a> question that I posed and blogged about earlier that week. It really go things going and there were some great points echoing the <a href="/2011/04/28/are-net-developers-scared-of-the-tech-community-and-cutting-edge-technologies.html#disqus_thread">comments</a> made in my post.</p>
<p>The day ended with some a whole group of us grabbing some food where I was lucky enough to be surrounded by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/stack72">Paul Stack</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/chriscanal">Chris Canal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/gep13">Gary Park</a> where we unsurprisingly discussed Continuous Integration, MVC, SOLID, Paul's phone being stolen last week, jobs, tech stuff and quite a lot of nonsense. Generally fun chat!</p>
<p>This was a really good community event which leaned heavily towards the Microsoft technology stack. With my recently blog post stirring up so much comment it was great to see an event like this and raises my hopes that .NET developers definitely do have a sense of community and we just need to get together to re-ignite the interest in Scotland. Microsoft also need to get involved and for the moment one big event a year probably isn't enough. <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developers</a> and <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen developers</a> are definitely doing what they can, and Scottish Developers in particular have now set a high standard with DDD Scotland, but we need to increase the interest in .NET technologies by attending events that aren't purely .NET focused and representing the .NET community.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2011/04/28/are-net-developers-scared-of-the-tech-community-and-cutting-edge-technologies.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a .NET guy and I'm excited and interested in cutting edge technologies. I've found the lack of a .NET community (particularly in Scotland) and not seeing enough developers who primarily using Microsoft technologies getting involved with tech communities <em>really</em> frustrating .</p>
<p>My feeling is that there aren't a lot of regular .NET events or general tech meetups involving .NET. This is for a number of reasons; bad feeling towards Microsoft, difficult access to Microsoft technologies due to cost and Microsoft's undoubted focus on enterprise to name but a few. With the exception of Aberdeen <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">techmeetup</a> (due to all the Oil companies up there) the majority of developers at techmeetup events don't seem to be using Microsoft technologies. That doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't the developers - my feeling is that they just don't go to those sorts of things. Techmeetup Edinburgh, <a href="http://refreshedinburgh.org/">Refresh Edinburgh</a> and Techmeetup Glasgow is full of non-MS guys.</p>

<p>The only .NET events and communities, accessible to me, that I know about are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen .NET User Group</a>, <a href="http://scotalt.net/">Scot ALT.NET</a> (seems pretty inactive)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/">Developer Developer Developer Scotland</a> (held once a year - I'm going to it)</li>
<li><a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/category/events/book-club-events/">A book club</a> (just heard about this today)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of this can be found via the <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developers</a> site. If I'm honest I'm not all that bothered that there are .NET focused groups, it's more that the .NET devs don't seem to get involved in the existing communities.</p>
<p>Are tech communities driven by the startup up scene and this is why we don't see developers who use .NET at these events? I bet 95% of all startups do not use Microsoft technologies. Why? <a href="http://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard</a>, an Edinburgh (or close-by), startup built things on the Microsoft technology stack. Are there any others?</p>
<p>Another annoyance I have is that a lot Microsoft devs don't seem to want to try out new technologies. Is this because they work at financial services companies who are still using .NET 2.0, have some legacy VBScript systems to maintain and are still targeting IE6? Another way of looking at this is that Ruby, PHP and Python developers are commonly found at tech events, are always trying out new technologies and aren't afraid to upgrade to get new features following a new release of something.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>If I'm not wrong why is this the case and what are Microsoft doing about it? What are we doing about it?</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=18909</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/publishmydata.jpg" alt="" title="Publish My Data" width="150" height="35" class="imgRight" />The number of “as a Service” types continues to grow and we are even seeing services that help you build your own service. PublishMyData falls into this category as it offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) which enables you to offer your Data as a Service (DaaS). The company&#8217;s focus is to help those with data share it in a standard format and in an accessible way.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishmydata.com/">PublishMyData’s website</a> sums up its offering as:</p>
<blockquote><p>We can help you publish accessible, queryable, Linked Data on the Web so that it&#8217;s easy for people to find, understand and re-use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement not only defines what PublishMyData are trying to achieve but also the point of <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a>. Linked Data is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">described on Wikipedia</a> as:</p>
<blockquote><p>a method of publishing structured data, so that it can be interlinked and become more useful. It builds upon standard Web technologies, such as HTTP and URIs &#8211; but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the complexity involved in converting any data in any format into Linked Data the publishing process isn’t fully automated at present and there will be some consultancy involved. However, in the longer term there are plans to expose their publishing tools and move towards a much more self-service model: a kind of Content Management System for linked data driven sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/PublishMyDataProcess.gif" alt="" width="564" height="253" /></p>
<p>Once the data has been analysed and processed to be more accessible and queryable as Linked Data it can then be made available on a customized portal, including a highly accessible and standardized <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> API (a query language for RDF), for the client. In addition it can be hosted, or at least referred to, in the PublishMyData service. If it is made available via PublishMyData it will be listed in their <a href="http://publishmydata.com/datasets">datasets list</a>. Although PublishMyData will have data available directly on their site and through their hosted API it is not aiming to become a data market or data index themselves &#8211; rather an enabling platform for others who want to make their data accessible.</p>
<p>Although it might appear that PublishMyData is a similar service to <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/factual">Factual</a> there are a number of differences. Factual are looking to make their site a destination,  appear to be focusing on offering a service to host the data, defining the subject matter and get users using their API. PublishMyData in comparison are looking to offer a service that lets data owners offer their own portal where they can keep ownership of their data and control access to their API. Factual does not appear to be offering access to its data in a standardized format (i.e. something defined by the W3C) and its <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/factual">Factual API</a> uses a customized query syntax, whilst PublishMyData is trying to offer access to data in a potentially more standardized format (Linked Data/RDF) and offer filtering and querying using a standard query language (SPARQL).</p>
<p>PublishMyData offers a <a href="http://publishmydata.com/sparql">nifty tool</a> that lets you execute SPARQL queries and once you are happy with your query you can use the relevant SPARQL API endpoint to access the data from code. The API can return data in a number of formats including xml, json, text, csv and tsv. The data is also accessible following the basic <a href="http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/69/slides/geopriv-4.pdf">HTTP-dereferencing</a> approach that is core to Linked Data.  In addition, the company is working on adding in some non-SPARQL, more &#8216;traditional&#8217; HTTP API functions, to make some common functionality available without the user needing any knowledge of SPARQL which should really reduce the barrier to entry.</p>
<p>PublishMyData is a relatively new service and Bill Roberts of PublishMyData explains their focus for the past few months:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our main focus over the last couple of months has been setting up some trials with data owners to publish their data.  We&#8217;re aiming mainly at the UK public sector at the moment and in the process of setting up a few client-specific sites built on our platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently PublishMyData has teamed up with Aberdeen City council and a government department to publish their data. Bill explains further:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far most of the government focus on open data and transparency has been around public spending, but these examples should move the discussion on a bit.  With the council [Aberdeen City] we&#8217;re looking at how linked data can help the communication between citizens and council, and how the delivery of public services can be enhanced.  With the government department, we&#8217;ll be presenting some important &#8217;state of the nation&#8217; statistics in a way that should be a lot more accessible than the usual government approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://linkeddata.aberdeencity.gov.uk/">Aberdeen Council PublishMyData portal</a> has just been made available and the number of DataSets will grow over time.</p>
<p>PublishMyData is constantly on the lookout for useful data so if you have any data that you would like to share or if you want some data but can’t get hold of it then PublishMyData would like you to <a href="http://publishmydata.com/about-us">get in touch</a>. If you are interested in finding out more about Linked Data then the PublishMyData website, this <a href="http://dailyjs.com/2010/11/26/linked-data-and-javascript/">post on Linked Data and JavaScript</a> and Learn Linked Data (by PublishMyData) are good starting points.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Who Curates the Real-Time Web?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=18775</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=18775</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/4011035061/"><img class="imgRight" title="Real-time" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/stopwatch.jpg" alt="Real-time" width="100" height="75" /></a><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> was the source of a flood of real-time information on the web. Information flowed from attendees using social media tools to share what was being discussed, their thoughts and their experiences. This information was amplified further by the information be re-shared (retweeted on Twitter) and by other opinions being expressed about all things SXSW. But how is it that you ensure you don&#8217;t miss an important piece of information from within your social media connections or even outside of your normal social media circles? From an earlier <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/02/15/cadmus-offers-algorithmic-twitter-feed-curation/">post on Cadmus</a>, an algorithmic Twitter feed service, you may be aware of the idea of curation &#8211; filtering content to ensure that you don&#8217;t miss the most relevant information. But who performs this curation and what roles do technology have in the process?out</p>
<p>It is technology that has made it possible for us to produce, share and consume so much information. We are living in a time that is often referred to as an era of digital overload. It&#8217;s therefore very interesting and essential that the cause of this data overload should also be the solution: Technology, in combination with human input, can help us solve these new problems through automated curation of data.</p>
<p>SXSW ran a panel covering this subject: &#8220;<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP7907">Humans Versus Robots: Who Curates the Real-Time Web?</a>&#8220;. The panel consisted of representatives from curation services including Henry Nothhaft from <a href="http://trap.it/">Trapit</a>, Jim England from <a href="http://keepstream.com/">Keepstream</a>, Sam Decker from <a href="http://www.massrelevance.com/">Mass Relevance</a>, Xavier Damman from <a href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a>, and Megan McCarthy from <a href="http://www.mediagazer.com/">Media Gazer</a> who chaired the discussion. Unsurprisingly there wasn&#8217;t a definitive answer to this question. The answer really depends on the data that is being curated. It was agreed that automated curation (robots) was required in cases where there was so much data that it would not be possible for humans to possibly curate. However, the consensus was that generally once the amount of data had been reduced to a more acceptable level that it was humans who could provide the best form of curation since they can understand and apply more context and objectivity to any data. Technology will of course improve and we&#8217;ll see the robots getting smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>Curation cannot be solved by any one technology and it will require smooth interaction and integration between numerous technologies in order to solve this problem. APIs will play a massive part in the curation process and we&#8217;ve already seen this directly through the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/cadmus">Cadmus API</a> and within services such as <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/17/browse-build-and-share-real-time-streams-with-datasift/">DataSift</a>, where they use third party services such as <a href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a>, <a href="http://www.peerindex.net/">Peer Index</a> and <a href="http://www.lexalytics.com/solutions/enterprise-software">Salience</a> for influence and sentiment analysis. DataSift provide a delivery and curation service but they can&#8217;t do everything on their own which is why they have outsourced some parts of the process to other services. As more curation techniques and algorithms are identified we&#8217;ll see these techniques exposed through additional services and APIs and in turn these APIs will be integrated into other curation services.</p>
<p>The amount of information being published to the real-time web is going to increase and as it does so will the importance of curation. It might not be long until it will be essential in ensuring that we don&#8217;t all suffer digital overload. How long will it be before Twitter.com and the ever increasing list of official Twitter clients, who presently only offer manual curation through selective follows and lists, join in and add curation to their service? Will they build it themselves, use a number of the available APIs (unlikely based on the amount of data) or make another acquisition?</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Real-Time Web or Right-Time Web?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=18560</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=18560</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/booleansplit/2201440179/"><img class="imgRight" title="Pull? Push?" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/pull-push.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="75" /></a>Real-time and the real-time web continue to be a hot topic of conversation but is the term “real-time” getting used correctly? When we talk about real-time technology are we truly describing what the technology is delivering or is it being used and abused as just another marketing buzz word? Can we class any of the current technology solutions as truly real-time and can other solutions be defined in any other way? Is it too late to save “real-time” or will it forever be lost to marketing?</p>
<p>Back in July 2009 even Wikipedia <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">didn’t have a definition for “Real-Time Web”</a> although it was being used by a lot of companies to describe their products and services. Wikipedia does have a definition now and the fundamental top-level definition is:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real-time web is a set of technologies and practices that enable users to receive information as soon as it is published by its authors, rather than requiring that they or their software check a source periodically for updates.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key point here is that the information should be received by the users as soon as it is published <strong>without</strong> the need to periodically check the source for updates. To make this even simpler let’s define this as “Push, not Pull”.</p>
<p>We’ve previously discussed real-time technologies and services in our <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/06/real-time-data-delivery-http-streaming-versus-pubsubhubbub/">HTTP Streaming v PubSubHubbub</a> article but haven’t defined this fundamental point of Push, not Pull. Push should be core to any real-time technology as demonstrated by HTTP Streaming, WebSockets, PubSubHubbub, Webhooks and Comet and as used by <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/09/14/client-push-services-open-up-real-time-to-everyone/">real-time client push services</a> and services such as <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/20/superfeedr-introduces-real-time-client-push-capabilities/">Superfeedr</a> and <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/17/browse-build-and-share-real-time-streams-with-datasift/">DataSift</a>. Any event or notification based system needs to use Push in order to instantly deliver information to all interested parties (a User viewing a UI or a 3rd party system). The current version of Real-Time Web on Wikipedia lists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real-time_web&amp;oldid=417242073#True-realtime_web_.28an_.22alternate.22_model.29">a “True real-time web” alternative</a> description which attempts to better define the experience and technologies required to deliver a true real-time web experience but it is in need of some refinement.</p>
<p>What this means is that products, services and systems that currently use a Pull mechanism to deliver data, specifically in the form of polling, within their real-time service or application aren’t truly real-time. This doesn’t mean that the service or application isn’t valuable, it just means they are using technology that does not fall under the definition of a real-time web technology. A few examples of services and applications that use claim to be real-time web solutions but don’t use real-time web technology in their delivery of information to the web browser include (and you may be surprised by a couple):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.twitter.com">search.twitter.com</a> – 30 second polling intervals</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/webhp#q=real-time&amp;tbs=mbl:1&amp;oi=mode_link">Google real-time search</a> – 30 second polling intervals</li>
<li><a href="http://chartbeat.com/">Chartbeat</a> – polling seems to vary in their <a href="http://chartbeat.com/demo/">dashboard demo</a> between 10 and 15 seconds</li>
<li><a href="http://aboutecho.com/">Echo</a> – a <a href="http://echosandbox.com/use-cases/commenting/">demo</a> shows a polling interval of 10 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what should they call their service is they can’t use “real-time”? If instant notification of new data isn’t necessary, and a service or application has chosen to use a pull (polling) solution which delivers the data in a timely manner so that it is still useful then I would classify this as a “right-time web” solution. Right-time Web technology should not be confused with the <a href="http://dpakman.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/the-right-time-web/">right-time web idea</a> which is about ensuring you get relevant information. Right-time web technology ensure you get the information you are interested in whilst it is still relevant and in a lot of cases polling solutions can achieve this.</p>
<p>Real-time web technologies should be used when the instant delivery of data is required – when seconds or even milliseconds really matter. That’s why these technologies have been pioneered in the financial sector and have been <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/02/25/the-evolution-and-future-of-real-time-browser-push/">in that sector for over 10 years</a> and have only recently moved into wider adoption. There is also an argument that push technology can actually be more efficient than polling since updates are pushed only when new data is available where as polling solutions always make a request at a given interval even if no new data is available leading to wasted client/server round trips.</p>
<p>Right-time web technologies can be used when the instant delivery of data isn’t important and when delivering data within a set interval, normally 10, 20 or 30 seconds doesn’t impact the value of that data.</p>
<p>It’s probably too late for the terms “real-time” and the “real-time web” and as they have already been hijacked and will continue to be used even when the underlying technology, and the experience that is being delivered, isn’t truly real-time and would be better being referred to as right-time web solutions. Real-time and the real-time web are instead going to continue to be used as umbrella terms for technologies, services and applications that want to present themeselves as cutting edge so it would appear that real-time web and right-time web technologies are going to continue to be incorrectly synonymous.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Should Cloud APIs Focus on Client Libraries More Than Endpoints?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17946</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17946</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/2511369048/"><img class="imgRight" title="Clouds" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/clouds-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="86" height="73" /></a>Cloud APIs are all about the endpoints: some services follow the current trend of providing a RESTful end point, others use older protocols such as RPC or SOAP, some use newer – push focused – endpoints like WebSockets or HTTP Streaming, others may offer a number of different endpoints to meet different requirements and some just use what seems to be best for a specific job which might mean not strictly following protocol rules. But is providing an endpoint to a service alone good enough? Should a developer really have to care about how a service is built or accessed when they can use a client library?</p>

<p>This post was very much inspired by William Vambenepe’s blog post called <a href="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1712">Cloud APIs are like military parades</a> which focuses on the current trend of REST APIs but it also covers some interesting questions and one very key one:</p>
<p><em>How many developers actually directly access an endpoint and how many access a service through a library?</em></p>
<p>So, should cloud services just be providing endpoints and relying on community, open source and developers to build libraries that make access to their service easier? Should they just provide samples or small helper libraries? Or should a library be provide by the cloud service vendor and be considered a key part of that service?</p>
<p>There may not be right or wrong answers to these question, it may very well depend on the complexity involved in using the service API.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17940" title="All time top mashups" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/AllTimeTopMashups.png" alt="" width="474" height="256" /></p>
<p>A look at the all time most popular APIs used by mashups in our <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis">API directory</a> unsurprisingly lists Google Maps, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon and Facebook. The <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/mashups/directory/1?sort=popular">most popular mashups</a> listing also confirms this with a heavy focus on the mashups using mapping APIs.</p>
<p>Mapping APIs are quite complex due to the UI aspect of the service and the majority of libraries are provided by the cloud service vendor. Twitter has developed a <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/libraries">large array of libraries</a> built by an “ecosystem” of developers, Facebook provides a suite of <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/sdks">SDKs and Tools</a>, Flickr provides <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">API Kits</a>, the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/youtube">YouTube API</a> consists of <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/youtube/getting_started.html#player_apis">libraries for visual-oriented functionality</a> and raw access to a data API and finally Amazon offer SDKs for access to AWS APIs and provide <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/code/Product%20Advertising%20API?_encoding=UTF8&amp;jiveRedirect=1">code samples</a> for accessing their product advertising one.</p>
<p>Big cloud API players are clearly making an effort to give developers a running start when using their APIs. In the majority of cases some raw API access is available but samples, SDKs and libraries can be found in abundance and have quite frequently been developed by the company itself.</p>
<p>So, do cloud services offer API endpoints just to meet the needs of a very small percentage of developers who want to make raw calls to an API? Do they do it in order to enforce good development practice? Or is the main benefit that it encourages developers and open source advocates to get involved with a service and built a community? What do you think?</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17796</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17796</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/4011035061/"><img class="imgRight" title="Real-time" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/stopwatch.jpg" alt="Real-time" width="100" height="75" /></a>During the past four months we&#8217;ve seen not one but two well known real-time search engines disappear. First there was <a href="http://www.oneriot.com/">OneRiot</a>, which in October 2010 <a href="http://blog.oneriot.com/post/1299059218/oneriot-officially-launches-advertising-network-for-the">decided to focus on advertising</a>. More recently, <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/24/collecta-drops-its-real-time-search-api/">Collecta closed it&#8217;s real-time search engine and API</a> to focus on alternative real-time products. Digging further into real-time search offerings you will also discover that <a href="http://www.crowdeye.com/">crowdeye</a> has also decided to pull its real-time search engine. This now appears to leave <a href="http://topsy.com/">Topsy</a>, a OneRiot partner, and of course Google as the main players focusing on building a real-time search destination. Does this trend signal the end for all real-time search engines or just that their focus has been wrong?</p>
<p>There are a couple of quotes that seem to indicate what the problem has been for some of these real-time search engines. On the front page of crowdeye there is now the paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we have been successful pushing the state of the art forward with features like location-based search, relevance sorting of results and sentiment, we have not yet built a profitable business around CrowdEye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OneRiot blog post that announced the move to focus on advertising states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, of course, since OneRiot has been around we’ve been known as leaders in the realtime search space. In reality, we’ve been in the market with two products that leverage the same underlying technology platform: consumer-facing realtime search and an innovative advertising product that monetizes both realtime search the wider realtime social web. Our advertising platform has taken off like a rocket – both in terms of network growth and the number of advertisers who are seeking to engage with the social influencers across that network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is monetization. Isn&#8217;t it always!</p>
<p>As the real-time web exploded we saw a <a href="http://bit.ly/bundles/leggetter/b">bunch of real-time search engines</a> appear. That list has significantly decreased in size and of those that still exist at all quite a few have shifted focus.</p>
<p>So the question is what could they have done to monetize their real-time search engine product? The obvious solution is advertising and Google have already proven that this works and continues to do so. OneRiot have followed suit but have decided to drop the search destination offering and instead have chosen to partner with companies and offer value through the <a href="http://apidocs.oneriot.com/">OneRiot API</a>.</p>
<p>Using an API as a source of monetization isn&#8217;t a new idea with both Google and Amazon proving that this can be a fantastic revenue generator. Google provide access to a host of functionality through their APIs with a <a href="http://code.google.com/more/#google-ads">reasonable proportion</a> of them focused on advertising, monetization and revenue generation and Amazon offer the ability to generate revenue via their <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html">Product Advertising API</a> (<a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html">UK version</a>). However, what is interesting is that there appears to be a movement away from the absolute requirement that in order to generate revenue your product or service must be a destination &#8211; a website. By providing access to quality data, generated through ground breaking technology and exposed via an accessible API a service can be very successful.</p>
<p>Are real-time search engines dead? <strong>No</strong>. However the trends discussed above do indicate that consumers don&#8217;t seem to need, or want, as many real-time search destinations (websites). But that in no way means that we don&#8217;t need real-time search <em>engines</em> &#8211; we do still need technology products and services that can consume the vast amounts of real-time data being generated, extract value and expose this value to others. Therefore the engines will continue to be developed it&#8217;s just that the focus and the value exposed by these products may well shift away from being consumer focused and instead the target user will be the programmable web.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I did my first ever <a href="http://www.techmeetup.co.uk/">TechMeetup</a> talk yesterday in Aberdeen and my chosen subject, unsurprisingly, was <strong>The Real-Time Web</strong>. We started out discussing what real-time was, then what The Real-Time Web is and when receiving information in real-time mattered. I also went on to cover some of the key real-time web technologies including <strong>HTTP Streaming</strong>, <strong>PubSubHubbub</strong> and <strong>WebSockets</strong> and then on to <strong>real-time web services and platforms</strong>.</p>

<p>A big thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/aboynejames">@aboynejames</a> for suggesting I do the talk and <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc228/blog/">Bruce Scharlau</a> for inviting me along. I'd also like to thank everybody who attended and made me feel very welcome and certainly seemed interested.</p>
<h3 id="feedback"><a href="#feedback">Feedback</a></h3>
<p>If you where there then please leave a comment letting me know what you thought or just to let me know who you are. If you'd rather email you can get me using <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=Aberdeen TechMeetup">phil@leggetter.co.uk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="video"><a href="#video">Video</a></h3>
<p>Here's a video of the first 10 minutes of the talk. Unfortunately the video recorder ran out of batteries.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19060295" width="400" height="227" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Unfortunately I can't find a way of showing my slide notes in the above embeded Google Presentation so here they are in pretty rough form.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-real-time?"><a href="#what-is-real-time?">What is Real-Time?</a></h4>
<p>Respond or react within a predictable time after an event has occurred.</p>
<p>There may also be a maximum time constraint.</p>
<p>Because after that maximum time the information loses value and context.</p>
<p>Maybe we should really call it:<br />
Right-Time</p>
<h4 id="when-does-real-time-matter?"><a href="#when-does-real-time-matter?">When does Real-Time matter?</a></h4>
<p><strong>When does NOW matter?</strong></p>
<p>When do you think being informed of something the instant it occurs really matters?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical systems</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>Live events</strong> where things lose context.</li>
<li>Systems requiring synchronisation:<br />
The 2Screen experience e.g. <a href="http://tellylinks.com">TellyLinks.com</a></li>
<li>Interactive/collaborative things e.g. chat, Google Wave, Google Docs (docs, spreadsheets, drawing)</li>
<li><b>Sensor data</b> e.g. Car ABS breaks</li>
<li><strong>Trading</strong>: You've got to be sure you are seeing the correct trade price in order to be able to make a decision on whether to trade or not.</li>
<li><strong>Betting</strong>: You want to make sure you bet at the right odds and you don't want clients to be able to bed when the odds have changed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="evolution-of-the-web"><a href="#evolution-of-the-web">Evolution of the Web</a></h4>
<p><strong>From Pull to Push</strong></p>
<p>Although I'm going to use the Web Browser as the example client the client could of course be anything. Another web server any desktop application, a mobile application, an embedded app on any device.</p>
<p>I'm also going to focus on HTTP but the mechanisms could be applied to standard TCP socket connections.</p>
<h4 id="http-pull-(request,-response)"><a href="#http-pull-(request,-response)">HTTP Pull (Request, Response)</a></h4>
<p>Note: client. This can be a web browser but doesn't have to be.</p>
<p>1) Each request would result in a page reload.<br />
2) Event occurs on server there's no way of the server telling the browser.<br />
3) e.g. chat pages where you would need to click the "Refresh" button to see what other users are saying </p>
<h4 id="http-polling"><a href="#http-polling">HTTP Polling</a></h4>
<p>A user hitting F5 or clicking the refresh button is one manual example.</p>
<p>1) REFRESH-META<br />
2) Then frames<br />
3) XMLHttpRequest -&gt; Outlook web access (ActiveX object) </p>
<p>Check if the information has changed by polling.</p>
<p>The problem with this is you can easily waste requests and it can be resource intensive for both the client and the server.</p>
<p>A large amount of services still take this approach although the web, and the technologies, have evolved to allow for real-time push.</p>
<p>For quite some time I've said if a service uses HTTP Polling when push technology is available and a much better option that <a href="http://itsnotrealtime.com">it's not real-time</a></p>
<h4 id="http-push"><a href="#http-push">HTTP Push</a></h4>
<p>In this diagram you could replace the Client with Server. The initialization could be classed as a subscription or webhook.</p>
<p>Various techniques have been developed to hold a connection open to a web server from a browser.</p>
<p>Difficulties :</p>
<p>* Proxies/Firewall<br />
* Connection reselience<br />
* Browsers<br />
* Messaging API</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17676</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17676</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/datasift"><img class="imgRight" src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at2922.png" alt="DataSift" /></a>A core feature of the real-time web is the continuously updating real-time streams of information. These streams are commonly generated by social networks and with the continued uptake of social networking the amount of information is only going to increase. This will continue to introduce opportunities for companies to create products and services that extract value from that vast amount of data. Some of the most common services built around these streams include trend and sentiment analysis, data storage, aggregation, sorting, search and filtering. <a href="http://datasift.net/">DataSift</a> is a service that offers a host of exciting features including the ability to let users browse, build and share their own real-time streams using social media data drawn from a host of sources.</p>
<p>DataSift <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/tweetmeme-founders-datasift-helps-you-find-a-needle-in-a-tweetstack/">launched</a> its Alpha service at TechCrunch Disrupt in September and describe it as a &#8220;real time social media filtering engine.&#8221; The initial buzz around DataSift was generated when Twitter agreed to give them access to the Twitter firehose, but they now have access to a much wider range of data including the Google Buzz, MySpace, SixApart, WordPress, Facebook and Digg. These sources of data within DataSift, sometimes called input services, are defined as <a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/fsdl/targets">Targets</a> in the DataSift knowledge base.</p>
<p>Users can use Targets to <a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/getting-started/creating-your-first-stream">create their own streams</a> from within the My Streams section of the DataSift dashboard using a language called <a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/fsdl/an-introduction-to-fsdl">FSDL</a> (Filtered Stream Definition Language). The Web editor used to define your streams is pretty simple but it does provide some basic syntax highlighting as well as validating your syntax whenever you save. FSDL also provides access to <a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/targets/targets-augmentations">augmentation Targets</a> through services such as Salience, TweetMeme, Peer Index, Klout and InfoChimps that allow streams to be augmented with third party data.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" title="DataSift Stream Edit Definition Page (FSDL)" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FSDLEditor.png" alt="" width="602" height="326" /></p>
<p>Once a stream has been defined you can choose to build your feed. At present this takes up to 60 minutes and the dashboard will show you the progress of the build as well as a host of other features including a data preview, a live example of the data, a graph showing matched stream items (iterations per minute) and the history of the feed definition.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Nick Halstead (CEO of DataSift) has provided a clarification about the stream preview, the live stream feature and also when the stream can be used via the API:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stream ‘preview’ does not need to be built for anything to work, you can define + attach to API immediately (or just hit ‘live’ tab to see live results) – the preview was to allow stream owners to demonstrate what the stream would offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see Nick&#8217;s full comment in <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/17/browse-build-and-share-real-time-streams-with-datasift/#comment-167921">the comments section</a> below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DataSiftDashBoard.png"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" title="DataSift Stream Dashboard page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DataSiftDashBoard.png" alt="" width="592" height="485" /></a></p>
<p>DataSift is encouraging its users to build feeds that are discoverable and accessible to other users, although it does offer a private feed option, by providing a number of options on the stream page including tagging, an area to encourage you to tell others about it on common social networks and a comments area to encourage users to interact and visits to the stream page. Recently added, most commented and top rated streams are also featured on the home section of the DataSift dashboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" title="DataSift Dashboard Homepage" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/DataSiftDashBoardHome.png" alt="" width="596" height="478" /></p>
<p>Once the stream has been built it <a href="http://blog.datasift.com/2010/12/10/building-on-top-of-other-streams/">can also be used</a> in the definition of another user stream, and it in another stream and so on. DataSift really have exposed a lot of functionality and capabilities within their user dashboard and the <a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb">documentation</a> that they provide is quite thorough and really helps a user get to grips with creating streams reasonably quickly.</p>
<p>All these rich features would be a waste unless there was a way of accessing the data and using it with an application. Unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/datasift">DataSift API</a> delivers by providing three endpoints, including access to filtered data in a paged manner, HTTP Streaming and an RSS endpoint. It also recently introduced a <a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/streaming-api/websocket-streaming">WebSockets Streaming API</a>.</p>
<p>Although DataSift is still in Alpha it is offering what seems <a title="DataSift pricing" href="http://datasift.net/pricing?hash=8ee1d6ba2359b33a8a0427723bfec28f&amp;id=2402">an affordable</a> and very impressive service which should excite any developer interested in real-time technologies and data. The company&#8217;s access to a wide range of data sources, engaging and intuitive user dashboard and range of API endpoints should mean that most developers will have their technology needs met.</p>

<p>A good starting point to learn about DataSift is an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7aiKaCi8O8">interview</a> by Robert Scoble with Nick Halstead, the CEO of DataSift (embedded above). The video is a little old but provides a good overview and an example of creating a stream. If you&#8217;ve any comments or questions about DataSift please leave a comment here. After that you should head over to <a href="http://datasift.net">http://datasift.net</a> and register for the DataSift Alpha program.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brightwurks.com">Brightwurks</a>, who develop <a href="http://www.feedmyinbox.com/">Feed My Inbox</a>, have just posted a <a href="http://www.brightwurks.com/blog/real-time-delivery-explained">blog article</a> explaining the Real-Time Delivery of blogs, feeds and news to an email inbox. The article discusses polling and real-time protocols. They list the Twitter API as a real-time protocol although they do know it's not actually an example of a real-time protocol and explain this later in the post. I've just posted a comment clarifying that although the Twitter API is not a real-time protocol it does use a real-time technology that we are starting to see being used more and more to deliver data in real-time.</p>

<p>Here's my comment in full slightly edit to better suit a blog post.</p>
<blockquote><p>As you state the Twitter API is not a real-time protocol. I'm assuming that you will be using one of Twitters streaming APIs - either the <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api_methods#statuses-filter">filter API method</a> or maybe the <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/user_streams">users streams API</a>.</p>
<p>Although not a real-time protocol these are examples of using a HTTP Streaming API to receive instant notifications. HTTP Streaming seems to be becoming the API technology of choice when the speed of notifications really matters and I think we are going to see a lot more APIs offer this. I wrote an article recently on Programmable Web that covers this topic a bit further and discusses <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/06/real-time-data-delivery-http-streaming-versus-pubsubhubbub/">HTTP Streaming verses PubSubHubbub</a>.</p>
<p>So, I would suggest you update the real-time protocols section and state HTTP Streaming being another method for real-time data delivery (still not strictly a protocol), use the Twitter API as an example of an API using HTTP Streaming to deliver data in real-time and also update the docs links to point to <a href="http://dev.twitter.com">dev.twitter.com</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this information is useful.</p></blockquote>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just posted <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/01/10/predictions-for-2011-3-the-rise-of-multi-user-multi-device-tablet-applications/#comment-2030">a comment</a> on a really good article by Kate Ho of Startup Cafe about her predictions on <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/01/10/predictions-for-2011-3-the-rise-of-multi-user-multi-device-tablet-applications">the rise of multi-user, multi-device table applications</a>. Obviously my comments are focused really on the technology behind such a rise. Here's my comment in full, slightly edited to be a bit more readable as a blog post.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/01/10/predictions-for-2011-3-the-rise-of-multi-user-multi-device-tablet-applications/#comment-2030"><p>
Kate - another very insightful post. And another set of predictions that I completely agree with you about and really excite me because I'm working on technology that makes this possible and more easily accessible. For multi-user games and collaborative applications the information about a player move, new document update or chat notification generally needs to be instantly sent to all other users. Even where real-time is not absolutely essential to the application a push notification is still more beneficial (UX and resource usage) than notification via polling.</p>
<p>During the last year we started to see, or at least notice, a lot more real-time collaboration applications and games which used the Internet as the network for the messages. In <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/09/14/client-push-services-open-up-real-time-to-everyone/">this post</a> I wrote for Programmable Web on real-time client push services the first screenshot is of a web-based scrabble-like game.</p>
<p>Some other well know examples are Google Docs documents, drawing and <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=44680">spreadsheets real-time collaboration</a>, <a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a>, <a href="http://pbworks.com/real-time-collaboration">PBWorks</a> and real-time chat services such as <a href="http://nurph.com">Nurph</a> (although they currently use polling). I also think that services such as <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, a UI mocking app, plan to introduce real-time collaboration functionality.</p>
<p>The user experience side of things is also very interesting. When real-time data delivery becomes a possibility the application developer really needs to consider how this impacts the UX. Just because you can stream 1000's of tweets a minute into an application it doesn't mean you should. search.twitter.com is a good example of this; they've chose to just show a notification that new tweets are available rather than actually push them into view. These two examples also show notifications being pushed into view:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.twitterfall.com/">Twitter Fall</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/javascript-examples/simple-twitter-subscriber/">Simple real-time streaming of Tweets demo on Kwwika (click on NOWPLAYING)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love to know what people think about this and hear any idea about how we can solve this real-time notification UX problem.</p>
<p>During 2011 I absolutely believe that we will start to see a lot more real-time and cross platform collaborative applications and games where one user may be on a smartphone, another on a PC running in a web browser and another on a native iPad app. These applications will be powered by real-time technologies either hosted by the game or application developers or using one of the real-time push notification and messaging services that started up last year.</p>
<p>My hope is that people will choose to use a service for that infrastructure and that <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a> is well placed to fill that role by having a foundation of technology developed over 10 years and <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api">APIs</a> for the majority of technologies (JavaScript [Web], Objective-C [iPhone/iPad], C, Java, .NET, Flash, Silverlight).

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2010/12/delivery-as-a-service.html">Delivery as a Service</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_as_a_Service">Data as a Service</a> (both <strong>DaaS</strong>) are definitely going to be big in 2011. Things really kicked off in 2010 with the emergence of companies focusing on real-time data delivery and mobile. We also started to see really exciting services focused on delivering real-time client push notifications to web browsers. I would put <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a> in both of these categories.</p>

<p>As 2011 continues we might to see some of these companies either partner up or start to tread on each others toes as they look at delivering data to alternative platforms and clients. Ultimately we are going to see services offering real-time communication of any type to any web enabled device using the web as the network.</p>
<p><small>The following lists aren't 100% comprehensive and as time goes by I'll probably create some pages on my site dedicated to this information.</small></p>
<p>Here's the list of services I'm aware of and the type of service they offer and technology they use.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people have written up their thoughts on 2010. Whether the thoughts are personal or a look back at specific things such as real-time web products the purpose is the same; to reflect on what has happened during the year, an opportunity to realise what's been achieved, what hasn't, what could've been and how things can be learnt and bettered.</p>
<p>So, six days into 2011 I'm writing this blog post. It's purpose is all of the above but it will hopefully also act as a reminder to me about why I made some decisions. Why I'm here, and not there. What it is that drives me and what I want. And how my decisions were made after consulting and considering others. I also hope that it will explain a bit about work/life integration by demonstrating the problems that I've faced and that things can be achieved (ongoing) and opportunities created by following what you are passionate about (I'm midway through writing and reviewing this and there are definitely ups and downs).</p>

<p>The blog post is a personal post but since work is a big part of what I do, and I've made a decision to accept that rather than fight it (work life integration v work life balance), it's also relevant to what I do to make a living. If you are truly passionate about it can you really drop it at 18:00? Can I?</p>
<h2 id="january:-the-work/life-integration-decision"><a href="#january:-the-work/life-integration-decision">January: The Work/Life Integration decision</a></h2>
<p>I've been very aware that the standard 9 to 6 doesn't suit me. Heck, it probably doesn't suit a lot of people and most definitely doesn't mean you work when you are most likely to do your best work. How many developers work in to the night because they are "in the zone"? If you are in the office in the middle of London and your partner is waiting for you to get home from work it's highly unlikely that you are going to hang around until 2am. Especially when it takes over an hour to get home and the trains stop before midnight.</p>
<p>How many of us enjoy parts of our job but not all of it? How many only like a small portion or none at all, we just need it to pay the bills? I've had a nagging feeling about this for quite some time. In quite few of my jobs I've absolutely loved the work but disliked some of it. In others It's just got to the point where the dislike overpowered the enjoyable moments for far too long so I left. The thing is I would go home and then start thinking, solving problems, generating ideas and writing code again. I'd leave my job where I'd be writing code to go home and write code! I couldn't help but think there must be a better way.</p>
<p>Then in mid 2009 I read a couple of books by <a href="http://www.iansanders.com/">Ian Sanders</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1841127981?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1841127981">LEAP!: Ditch Your Job, Start Your Own Business &amp; Set Yourself Free</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1906465371?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1906465371">Juggle! Rethink Work, Reclaim your Life</a>). Juggle! in particular made me realise that I was already juggling a 9 to 6 job along with a few personal projects, some general dev consultancy as well as helping develop, and owning shares in, an e-commerce website. It made me think about what it was I was passionate about, what I enjoyed in my current job and what I would ultimately like to do and how I would like to achieve it.</p>
<p>Then in December 2009 I picked up a copy of Gary Vaynerchuk's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0061914177?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0061914177">Crush It! Why Now is the Time to Cash in on your passion</a> as part of going to <a href="/2009/12/09/how-real-time-does-real-time-have-to-be.html">an event</a>. There were a number of reasons why I liked this book and why it hit home. It wasn't the title nor was it that Gary signed it "It's real-time time!" - although that helped. Firstly it said to me that if you are passionate about something and, very importantly, good at it then you can make a living from it. From this point on it was all about building up the courage and belief that I could make something work. That my passion and expertise for the Real-Time Web could really help me achieve true work/life integration. That what I would do when I went home after my job is what I actually did as my job!</p>
<p>My plan was to try and build a reputation as a "Real-Time Web Software and Technology Consultant" (Evangelist) by blogging about real-time web technology, building cool real-time demos, playing with real-time APIs such as the Twitter Streaming API and generally enjoying myself whilst generating loads of really interesting, cool and useful content for others. The belief is that by doing this, and building your "personal brand" (sorry to anybody who doesn't like this term) that opportunities will present themself and you will also be able to react to opportunties that you see. And these opportunities will be related to the thing that you are passionate about. In my case this is real-time web software and technology and social media (hmmm, <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/894991073">The Word Media is wrong</a>). Along with the work I love I was aware that I would have to take on other work that would help pay the bills but hopefully the amount of this type of work would decrease as I became successful.</p>
<p>Just to be very clear: <strong>work/life integration is different from work/life balance</strong>. Work/life balance tends to be associated with having a defined work time, keeping your weekends free and not thinking about work when you walk out of the office or turn off your computer. I'm not looking for that. I love to work as long as I'm working on the things I love.</p>
<p>After discussing things with my family and friends I finally made the decision to choose work/life integration. This decision meant leaving <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin Systems</a>, for the second time, after they had taken me back just over two years earlier. It also meant moving back up to Scotland to be closer to both mine and Jo, my girlfriends, family. Since we were getting married in May 2010 and had hopes to start a family this was also a big factor in the decision.</p>
<p>So, it was time to have a chat with my bosses.</p>
<h2 id="february:-an-unexpected-opportunity"><a href="#february:-an-unexpected-opportunity">February: An unexpected opportunity</a></h2>
<p>I spoke to my bosses and explained what I was planning to do and why. I also started discussing the possibilities of still being able to use <a title="Awesome real-time web technology" href="http://www.caplin.com/caplin_technology.php">Caplin Systems excellent technology</a> of which I had a very good understanding. This is where things got interesting. I remember in one conversation begin told "if you are going to do that [use real-time web technology] we'd like to help you do it properly and support you". This was fantastic for a number of reasons. Firstly I could still use the technology, secondly it meant I had made a positive impact and was reasonably highly thought of, thirdly I would potentially have some kind of salary and finally it meant I had potentially created an opportunity to work on something I was truly passionate about. I had almost created my own role, exactly the sort of thing Ian Sanders talks about in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1906465371?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1906465371">Juggle</a>!</p>
<p>After a number of meetings, a presentation and quite a bit of research we came up with the idea of putting Caplin System's software "in the cloud" and offering it as a service for others to use (it took months to eventually come up with the name "Kwwika"). This wasn't the first time that "Caplin in the cloud" has been discussed but was an interesting way of taking the idea forward. During what would have been my notice period at Caplin I finished off some core work, handed over my development line manager duties and started to investigate putting "Caplin in the cloud". With a very small amount of effort we could clearly see that <a href="http://www.caplin.com/caplin_liberator.php">Liberator</a> (Caplin's real-time streaming server) performed excellently running on only a small Amazon Linux instance. We also tested clustering of instances, sharing data, publishing using what would previously be classed as our client APIs and it all worked very well. The unnamed project was given the go-ahead.</p>
<p>I got in touch with Ian and we met up for a coffee.</p>

<h2 id="&lt;strong&gt;march-&amp;-april:-moving-back-to-scotland-and-getting-started-with-kwwika&lt;/strong&gt;"><a href="#&lt;strong&gt;march-&amp;-april:-moving-back-to-scotland-and-getting-started-with-kwwika&lt;/strong&gt;"><strong>March &amp; April: Moving back to Scotland and getting started with Kwwika</strong></a></h2>
<p>In March 2010 we moved back to Scotland where I would be working from home in a flat in Broughty Ferry, near Dundee.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=6]</p>
<p>The time between March and May is unsurprisingly a bit of a blur. Work on Kwwika continued and lots was achieved including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika website</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com">Kwwika blog</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api/javascript">Kwwika JavaScript API</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api/net">Kwwika .NET API</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api/silverlight">Kwwika Silverlight API</a></li>
<li>Quite a few <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kwwika&amp;aq=f">videos showing off Kwwika</a></li>
<li>An impressive <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/leadersdebate-demo-retrospective">Kwwika real-time demo for the UK Election leaders debate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly for Kwwika it was becoming very clear that there was a market for real-time push services with the general interest that had been shown and the emergence of quite a few possible competitors including <a href="http://beaconpush.com">Beacon Push</a>, <a href="http://pusherapp.com">Pusher</a> and <a href="http://www.frozenmountain.com">Web Sync on-demand</a>. Although Kwwika is potentially a lot more than this it was a really encouraging sign.</p>
<p>Since all that had been done it's probably clear that the work/life integration had probably been very dominated by work. This had always been expected and Jo and I had accepted this because was a fantastic opportunity for me and I really felt I needed to put in as much time as possible to prove Kwwika as an idea. I'm not complaining. A lot of the work I was doing, building new APIs, building a brand for Kwwika, searching for potential uses for the technology and interacting with people who were interested in this sort of technology is what I wanted to do. It was a bit unfair on Jo though.</p>
<h2 id="may:-let's-get-married!"><a href="#may:-let's-get-married!">May: Let's get Married!</a></h2>
<p>Almost exactly one year after I proposed to Jo we got married. Because my focus was mainly on work Jo had done almost everything to organise the wedding. You'll be pleased to hear that I didn't check my email on my wedding day but unfortunately up until the day before and every day after I would be checking my email and replying to potential clients as well as ensuring the Kwwika service and demos were running as expected. Again, I didn't mind too much. The work was great but I was very aware my priorities were a bit off centre.</p>
<p>On the wedding day itself I was completely emmersed in the occasion and loved everything about the day from the ceremony to spending time with my beautiful wife, my friends and family. A <strong>big </strong>thanks to Jo's parents who hosted the event in their fantastic home, my new brothers and sisters in law, my new niece and nephew, my Mum, Dad and Granny for all their support and a <strong>MASSIVE </strong>thanks to Jo for saying "Yes".</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Married.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Unfortunately on every other day I was in a mindset where I was always thinking about Kwwika, did I have an email I should read and reply to, was the service running okay, were all the demo applications up and running. I don't regret anything up until this point but I do regret not taking more time off  to spend with my wife and try to relax a bit more around our wedding day.  Jumping ahead a little, this is also something that I regret about Christmas and New Year - although I wasn't nearly as bad I was always aware that I wasn't 100% relaxed.</p>
<p>In 2011 this will have to change: my mindset, not the married part!</p>
<p>At the start of May I also delivered a <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/the-real-time-web-workshop">Real-Time Web Workshop</a> at the SPA 2010 conference with <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/author/adamicaplincom/">Adam Iley</a> from Caplin Systems. It went fantastically and we got some excellent feedback putting our session 3rd for feedback scores in the entire conference. We really must do this workshop again.</p>
<h2 id="june,-july-and-the-world-cup"><a href="#june,-july-and-the-world-cup">June, July and the World Cup</a></h2>
<p>The World Cup was always going to be a big part of the year. Since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barnes_%28footballer%29">John Barnes</a> retired (some might say I was obsessed) my interest in league football has waned and my real focus has been England international football. As ever my hopes were high and I was massively let down by the England team along with the rest of a hopeful nation (yes, I'm an Englishman living in Scotland).</p>
<p>Just prior to the World Cup I had an idea for a <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/kwwika-world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app">competition for Kwwika</a>. I'd write <a href="https://github.com/Kwwika/kwwika-tweet-streamer">an app</a> that recieved all the World Cup Tweets from the Twitter Streaming API and push them through Kwwika. I'd then ask developers to do their best to subscribe to this data in Kwwika and use it to build a cool real-time web application and the best entry would win an Apple iPad (I'd heard they were all the rage). The competition started off a little slow but we eventually got a number of entries, some great publicity, and we decided to award two developers, <a href="http://aaronbassett.com/">Aaron Bassett</a> and <a href="http://gregdoesit.com/">Gergely Orosz</a>, an iPad. You can read the <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/kwwika-world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-1">winners announcment blog post here</a>.</p>
<p>Other Kwwika achievements during this time were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jQueryRealTimePushKwwikaPlugin">Kwwika real-time push plugin</a></li>
<li>Getting <a href="http://optasports.com/">Opta Sports</a> to provide some <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition#TOC-OptaSports-Data">real-time World Cup data</a> for the Kwwika World Cup competition</li>
<li>A bit of press coverage for Kwwika <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2010/07/06/want-your-web-kwwika/">StartupCafe</a> and <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/the-death-of-f5-ah-i-get-it">Innovation Focus Scotland</a> (actual article now offline)</li>
</ul>
<p>A big positive in June was going to Poland for Keith and Ewa's wedding. This was probably the first time that I felt work/life integration really worked. I got up in the morning and did some work and then spent a lot of the time with friends and enjoying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w">Krakow</a>. I was on holiday but I didn't mind doing a bit of work.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=7]</p>
<h2 id="dexter"><a href="#dexter">Dexter</a></h2>
<p>Jo and I have always loved the thought of having a dog and it wasn't until I started working from home that this was possible. We didn't feel it would be fair to work full time and leave a dog home alone. Jo was still looking for work after the move and the wedding so it gave us the opportunity for her to be able to look after a dog for a while almost fulltime - Jo was absolutely knackered every single day.</p>
<p>On June 29th 2010 we picked up Dexter. Anybody that <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/leggetter">follows me on Twitter</a> will know about <a href="http://dexterdog.com/">Dexter</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/Dexify">@Dexify on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dexter-Dog/139884982694736">Dexter's facebook page</a>). Dexter most definitely deserves a section all to himself.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=8]</p>
<p>To say that Dexter was a handful is an understatement. I can't say things have got much easier with him although he does't wee all over the place he still requires a lot of attention but he does bring a lot of joy into our lives and guarantees a good few laughs every single day.</p>
<h2 id="august---november:-continued-focus-on-work"><a href="#august---november:-continued-focus-on-work">August - November: Continued focus on work</a></h2>
<p>Things were strange between August and mid-November. I spent the majority of the time working but had very little visible to show for it. Under the hood of Kwwika we made really big strides with the infrastructure and we also created an admin web application that allowed us to set up users, API Keys, Groups, Topics and Permissions (the need for all this stuff will become clear this year). I also stopped blogging quite so much about Kwwika because it had become very clear that the lack of a user dashboard was a massive barrier to entry for users so my efforts to drive beta users to sign up wasn't leading to many real opportunities.</p>
<p>The only real visible things during this time were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built a <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/kwwika-superfeedr-real-time-demo-available">Kwwika-Superfeedr demo</a> showing how to stream real-time updates from Superfeedr into a web browser using Kwwika with the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/ASP.NET-MVC-PubSubHubbub-Subscriber/tree/Kwwika-Superfeedr-Demo">code available in GitHub</a>. Unfortunately I've taken the demo down as we've ran out of Superfeedr credits but the video that's embedded in the blog post shows the application in action.</li>
<li><a href="http://aaronbassett.com">Aaron Bassett</a> using Kwwika on <a href="http://the.meet140.com/">The Meet 140</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The work/life integration focus again was mainly on work with very few social activities going on and a lot of time spent sitting in front of a computer. The main problem here is that the work had moved away from interacting with others, away from evangelising about technology, away from adding value to APIs and over to what I'd class as bog stardard web development. I was struggling.</p>
<p>I did have a fortnightly trip down to London and a couple of trips out to see <a href="http://www.insitebright.com">insitebright</a> and also <a href="http://www.matadorgroup.co.uk/">Matador Digital</a> but other than that I spent a lot of time working home alone.</p>
<p>On top of the Kwwika work I also started doing some freelance writing for <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/profile/leggetter">Programmable Web</a> and did a small consultancy project with insitebright for a large oil company. This actually provided a nice focus away from Kwwika so when I came back to it I was fresh and I was much more willing and able to tackle the bits I was less keen to.</p>
<p>In August we went to <a href="http://www.gigha.org.uk/">Gigha</a> which is a small Isle off the west coast of Scotland. The weather was fantastic. It was the first time that I felt work really getting to me and I suffered my first ever migraine. That wasn't fun and acted as a sign that I was working way too hard.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=9]</p>
<p>Jo started work in September and although I had Dexter to keep me company I found working home alone very lonely. This is something that I'm still trying to find a solution for but think that social media can be part of the answer along with increased transparency of Kwwika. I'm also very aware that if Kwwika is a success it will mean a lot more client interaction and technology evangelism which I'm really looking forward to.</p>
<p>In October my very good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/Mark_Nicoll">Mark</a> married Lynne. I've been friends with Mark ever since I moved to Glenrothes in 1993. It was a fantastic day and the couple and the kids were really happy. Unfortunately I don't have any photos. I do have a very large and empty bottle of Jack Daniels though.</p>
<h2 id="december:-the-culmination-of-9-months-effort-and-relax-(almost-&amp;-temporarily)"><a href="#december:-the-culmination-of-9-months-effort-and-relax-(almost-&amp;-temporarily)">December: The culmination of 9 months effort and relax (almost &amp; temporarily)</a></h2>
<p>When I first started Kwwika I got in touch with <a href="http://www.optasports.com">Opta Sports</a>. One of the reasons I decided to leave Caplin (although, as you know, I haven't) was their financial focus. I would have preferred to see the technology applied to something I have more interest in and I'm interested in sport so this was a great first target. We started work on the <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/kwwika-powered-real-time-opta-sports-cricket">Real-Time Opta Sports Cricket widget - powered by Kwwika</a> in November and it was ready during December. I'm really excited to see Opta Sport's data streaming through Kwwika and I'm really hopefully that cricket data is just the start. I was particularly proud when Opta put the Kwwika logo on their homepage. And because Opta then released the <a href="http://www.calameo.com/read/000519587fb375ea2c4a8">Opta Annual 2010</a> we are also in the brochure. An awesome feeling!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/KwwikaInOptaBrochure.png"><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/KwwikaInOptaBrochure.png" alt="" width="631" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>The final part of the year was spent preparing to build the Kwwika User Dashboard. We've outsourced some of the development to insitebright which means the work I've got to do is design the UX and plumb the delivered HTML, CSS, JS and images into the server-side code (it'll probably be a bit more complicated than that but you get the idea). Again, this certainly isn't the sort of thing that I really want to be doing but I absolutely understand that it's essential to be able to deliver Kwwika as a service and break down the barrier to entry for users. As soon as I've finished this post I'll be writing a post on the <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com">Kwwika blog</a> about that.</p>
<p>I managed to relax a bit in the run up to Christmas and probably over compensated by trying to relax too much (i.e. just sat and watched TV). I now know I'd have been better doing something a bit more active as I feel I've done very little over the festive period and that just sitting still in front of terrible TV isn't relaxing at all. I'm actually more relaxed now. All this said I've always had the nagging feeling that I've a lot to do and prove with Kwwika which hasn't helped the attempts to relax. One thing that did help me relax was that after <a href="http://twitpic.com/2cx1dt">declaring that I wanted one</a> I finally got a "What are you looking at Dicknose?" t-shirt on Christmas day. Thanks Jo!</p>
<h2 id="start,-stop,-continue:-the-retrospective"><a href="#start,-stop,-continue:-the-retrospective">Start, Stop, Continue: The retrospective</a></h2>
<p>Since this is a retrospective I have to state what I now think I really should be doing (Start), what didn't work and I should Stop doing and what I think worked and I should Continue doing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Start:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spending more time with family and friends and generally socialising</strong>. I've had my first real experience of trying work/life integration and I need to make sure life gets a bit more of a look-in.</li>
<li><strong>Increase social media use</strong>: During lonely spells try and use social media to ensure I'm getting more interation. In Particular I'm really enjoying using <a href="http://www.quora.com/Phil-Leggetter">Quora</a> at the moment. Some of my friends already ask me why I share so much online and already think I use social media far too much. It's a  good question really especially when my tweets about Dexter probably  don't mix too well with my real-time web tweets. My answer is I come as a package. I'm going to be true to myself and whilst I do apply some thought to what I publish about myself and to the content of my publishing I'm going to continue this.</li>
<li><strong>Being more transparent</strong>: My friends would again point me to the last bullet point but in this case I mean with Kwwika in order to get feedback as early as possible and to try and get others to help me when I'm struggling to get feedback from elsewhere. My next Kwwika blog post is a move in this direction.</li>
<li><strong>Reading more</strong>: When I worked at Caplin I found I had time to read more. Reading stimulates the mind and really helps ideas grow. Although I've had moments like this over the past 9 months I feel my general absolute focus on Kwwika and the time it's taken up has actually resulted in a bit of a stagnation of ideas. I must find time to read books and more blog posts.</li>
<li><strong>Attending more tech and entrepreneur events</strong>: When I moved to Scotland I had planned to go to a lot of tech events in order to meet people, network and to generally get out and socialise with like-minded geeks. I've been to what seems like quite a few events but probably not too many given that this covers 9 months: 1 <a href="http://scottishleancircle.uses.hn/">Scottish Lean Circle</a>, 1 Edinburgh <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">TechMeetup</a>, 1 <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scottishlinkeddataswig/">Linked Data</a>, 1 <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/nosql1/">DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper NoSQL day</a>, the <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2010/">SPA 2010 conference</a>, 1 <a href="http://www.scotlandis.com/events/event-details/cloudcomputing">Making the Most of Cloud event</a>, 1 <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Edinburgh-Web-Design-And-Development-Meetup-Group/">Edinburgh Web Design and Development Meetup</a> and 1 <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-OpenCoffee-Club/">Edinburgh OpenCoffee Club morning</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Planning ahead a bit more</strong>: I'm not talking about the five year plan. I just mean general planning for the month ahead. I've got a roadmap for Kwwika, and <a href="http://leggetter.posterous.com/working-home-alone-tips-tip-1">plan each day</a> either the night before or first thing in the morning, so I also need a roadmap for social and life activity. This will better help me integrate my work and my life.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise again</strong>: Between mid-2009 and May 2010 I lost 12 kg for my wedding. I did it by using our <a href="http://waterrower.com/">Water Rower</a> and by running. I've put at least half of that back on. This time I've got a running companion - Dexter!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Continue:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My customer focus</strong>: I've spent a lot of time replying to emails for beta registration over the past 9 months. I want to make sure that each registration is treated as an individual to make sure that they get the most out of Kwwika. I strongly believe in providing exceptional customer service and that ultimately it will make a massive difference. <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/247583674/small-town-rules">Small town rules</a>! And I really do care.</li>
<li><strong>Working hard</strong>: As well of moments of working exceptionally hard I've experienced moments of what can only be described as burn-out. A week or two where I can't seem to apply the effort required to perform some of the tasks that, in and ideal world, I wouldn't have to do. I want to continue to work hard but I want to make sure that I do it consitently and the only way to do that is to rein myself in sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Finding people and companies to partner with</strong>: I've established a good relationship with Opta Sports, insitebright and Matador Digital as well as a few individual developers. It's important that I continue to do that both for Kwwika my own personal development.</li>
<li><strong>Writing two blog posts a week for <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">Programmable Web</a></strong>: I'm really enjoying writing <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/profile/leggetter">these blog posts</a>. They get a big audience, it's good for my "personal brand" (there we go again) and it's a great way of discovering new technologies and also trying them out.</li>
<li><strong>To be myself</strong>: It's all part of transparency and customer focus. I'm not the sort of person to play games and wheel n' deal. Maybe this is a problem in business but I'm going to do my best to make sure I don't give in to any kind of business rules if it goes against how I feel, who I am and what I believe in. I want people to believe and trust in me because I've proven myself to be a nice guy, fair, knowledgeable and unbiased and therefore the when I say or write something it has some weight and proven foundation. That way they will believe that when I say Kwwika is a great product they will give it a go and see that it is.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stop:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spending so much time in front of a computer</strong>: It causes mind stagnation. I remember when I first began working at Caplin a <a href="http://pipl.com/directory/people/Peter/Belesis">senior developer</a> (only link I could find) telling me to take breaks. He smoked and would disappear for a cigarette but quite frequently that break would lead to a fresh way of looking at a problem. I need to take this idea and apply it to my work in general (no, not take up smoking). The family, friends and social activities are all part of a package that can actually help deliver my work. And the other way around, if I'm working on something I enjoy I will be happier with my friends and family. But here I am sitting in front of the computer at 2am - yeah, but I'm "in the zone"!</li>
<li><strong>Worrying about work when I have dedicated some time to life</strong>: Speaks for itself really. I need to have the confidence that things won't fall over when I'm not there. I actually know things are stable but I still worry. Maybe I just need a few additional processes in place. Actually I know I need and want somebody to work with me fulltime on Kwwika.</li>
<li><strong>Doing things that I'm either not good at or am simply not interested in</strong>: I want to move away from what I've already called bog-standard web<br />
development. I'm not a website builder. I don't have the passion for it<br />
and I never will. There are parts of building a website that are interesting but once the problems have been solved I lose interest. This is a bit of an ideal world scenario. But it's most definitely a goal. As already stated I love evangelising about real-time web technology, I love interacting with clients, sharing knowledge, helping and caring. I also enjoy concieving ideas and helping to see them realised. I love data, considering it's structure, working with APIs and developing new features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion---finally"><a href="#conclusion---finally">Conclusion - finally</a></h2>
<p>So, what is it I really want?</p>
<p>Family will always come first but after that I want work/life integration and to feel that work is benefiting from life and life from work. I want to spend time with my family and friends. I want to be working on the things that I'm passionate about and helping others that feel the same way and helping those that don't understand see the light (technology evangelism). I want to work with others whether it's colleagues, partners or clients. I want to concerntrate on the things that I'm good at and that I really enjoy: That's real-time web software and technology evanglism, concieving and realising how ideas can be achieved using this technology, deliverying customer service using social media by giving a damn (caring), sharing knowledge through blogging (and maybe a bit of vlogging), events and social media and working with others to create exciting products, services and solutions. I want to be happy and I believe this will "make it so".</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=17440</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/4011035061/"><img class="imgRight" title="Real-time" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/stopwatch.jpg" alt="Real-time" width="100" height="75" /></a>There are a number of ways of delivering data in real-time but until recently it has looked like <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a>, with the backing of Google, was going to be the preferred method. However, the past couple of weeks have seen a couple of interesting developments which could indicate that the developer community may actually prefer HTTP Streaming.</p>
<p>The emergence of the real-time web has seen an increase in the visibility of technologies that facilitate the delivery of data in real-time. Twitter was most probably the catalyst for this due to the many high profile cases where Twitter has been able to deliver the news before any other traditional news medium; the Hudson river plane crash is probably the best example of this. Some of the real-time technologies include PubSubHubbub, <a href="http://rsscloud.org/">RSSCloud</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>, <a href="http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/">XMPP</a>, <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/dataservices/">Adobe LiveCycle</a>, <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/">Google Wave Protocol</a>, <a href="http://wiki.webhooks.org/w/page/13385124/FrontPage">WebHooks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets">WebSockets</a> and HTTP Streaming to name but a few.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen an increase in the number of real-time services over the past year who have used these technologies. Services such as <a href="http://beaconpush.com/">Beacon</a>, <a href="http://datasift.net/">DataSift</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Google Buzz</a>, <a href="http://kwwika.com/">Kwwika</a> (disclosure: author is a founder), <a href="http://notify.me/">notify.me</a>, <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/">PubNub</a>, <a href="http://pusherapp.com/">Pusher</a>, <a href="http://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> and of course <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. You can also find a number of other <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/realtime">real-time APIs</a> in our directory.</p>
<p>HTTP Streaming has been generally associated with Ajax in the past. In fact the Wikipedia entry for HTTP Streaming (under the Push Technology page and listed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#HTTP_server_push">HTTP server push</a>) talks only about “sending data from a web server to a web browser.” This is out of date and HTTP Streaming is now much more than this. HTTP Streaming takes advantage of the fact that the Internet infrastructure has been built with HTTP in mind (as does PubSubHubbub). HTTP is fully supported so as well as using this protocol to distribute your static content such as HTML, images, CSS and JavaScript why not use it to distribute real-time data as well. The part of the Wikipedia definition for HTTP Streaming that is correct is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Generally the web server does not terminate a connection after response data has been served to a client. The web server leaves the connection open such that if an event is received, it can immediately be sent to one or multiple clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>A client in this context doesn’t have to be a web browser. It can be another web server, a desktop app, a mobile phone app, an embedded program running on a piece of hardware, a web application; basically any web enabled device capable of making a persistent HTTP connection.</p>
<p>This might be why services such as <a href="http://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a>, who consistently champions PubSubHubbub, have <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/20/superfeedr-introduces-real-time-client-push-capabilities/">introduced support for HTTP Streaming</a> and why new services like <a href="http://datasift.net/">DataSift</a> has provided <a href="http://support.datasift.net/kb/streaming-api/http-streaming-api">support</a> from almost day one.</p>
<p>So, why are services starting to offer HTTP Streaming? The first thing you may think is that a persistent HTTP connection might be a faster way of receiving data than PubSubHubbub and it’s intermittent HTTP Push requests. Surprisingly this isn’t supposed to be the case since “HTTP 1.1 reuses TCP connections <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html">by default</a>” as I <a href="http://www.onebigfluke.com/2010/09/common-misconception-explained-by-phil.html">recently found out</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that PubSubHubbub does require is that the push notifications have to be made to a web server. This means that PubSubHubbub is highly unlikely to be used for real-time client data delivery because client applications don’t tend to run their own web server. Therefore HTTP Streaming is a more accessible real-time data delivery mechanism since any technology that can make a web request, and hold a persistent HTTP connection, can receive real-time push notifications. This means that by offering a HTTP Streaming API a service can be consumed by anything from a hardware embedded system to a mobile application as long as they are connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>The other thing that PubSubHubbub does is define the message format. This can be seen as a positive and a negative but since we are seeing <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/03/json-continues-its-winning-streak-over-xml/">JSON continuing to win over XML</a> as the preferred data format it looks like PubSubHubbub will have to evolve away from XML to keep up as this <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Facebook-implement-PubSubHubbub-as-a-Subscriber">question on Quora suggests</a>.</p>
<p>This is an exciting trend which will most probably continue and will lead to us seeing truly real-time applications on any web-enabled device. It certainly doesn’t signal the end of the road for PubSubHubbub, which has its roots firmly in RSS (and XML), along with so much of the Internet. However, HTTP Streaming could become defacto standard for client push applications.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Yahoo’s Open Sourced S4 Could be a Real-time Cloud Platform]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=16860</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=16860</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img class="imgRight" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/s4.png" alt="Yahoo! S4" width="188" height="30" />In a world where real-time data streams are becoming much more common, and with the volume of that data continuing to increase, it makes sense that a framework would be developed to increase the ease at which that data can be processed. <a href="http://s4.io/">Yahoo! S4</a> isn&#8217;t the first such framework to be concieved, or even open sourced, but it is likely to massively increase awareness that such frameworks exist, what problems they may help solve and get developers thinking about how they could use the technology and potentially increase the likelihood of somebody moving S4-like capabilities into the cloud and offering it as as service.</p>
<p>The requirement for a &#8220;distributed stream computing platform&#8221; came about for Yahoo! in order to be able to process thousands of search queries per second, from potentially millions of users per day,  to facilitate the generation of highly <a href="http://labs.yahoo.com/node/474">personalized adverts</a> for web search. A new framework was required because Yahoo! felt that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a>, which is commonly used to process large datasets in batch jobs, was &#8220;hard to apply to stream computational tasks&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yahoo! describe the S4 framework using a number of terms that have become common place in the world of cloud computing:</p>
<blockquote><p>S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous unbounded streams of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly what Yahoo! S4 is, and what it is capable of, has been <a href="http://bit.ly/igjbDu">discussed</a> in a number of other places. The most commonly used term by <a href="http://bit.ly/g2GUVE">comparable frameworks</a> is <em>Complex Event Processing</em> with applications including filtering, correlation and pattern matching. These discussions will no doubt continue but ultimately a framework is something that can be put to multiple uses which is why Yahoo! chose to call it &#8220;general-purpose&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yahoo! have created a <a href="https://github.com/s4/examples">couple of examples</a> to demonstrate some of the basic capabilities and clarify what S4 can do. One of the examples recieves data from the Twitter real-time <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api_methods#statuses-sample">Garden Hose</a> stream, counts the number of times a hashtag is mentioned and keeps an ordered list of the most commonly mentioned hashtags. Each step of the process is performed in what Yahoo! are calling <a href="http://wiki.s4.io/Manual/S4Overview#toc6">Processing Elements</a> and it&#8217;s these elements that enforce the separation of each logical step of the process (e.g. recieve update, extract hashtags, count hashtags, order hastag count list)  and allow the execution of the process to take place on a distributed system.</p>
<p>One potential thing holding S4 adoption back is that as yet it&#8217;s not offered as a service. As well as writing their own Processing Elements developers will have to host their own distributed stream computing platform. If S4 proves to be a useful and popular framework then we may start to see <em>hosted</em> distributed stream computing platform services in the same way that we&#8217;ve already seen MapReduce being <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">offered as a service</a> by Amazon.</p>
<p>Yahoo! S4 is yet another powerful real-time component now available to the Programmable Web. It opens up a number of possibilities for developers to start building exciting data-centric applications, mashups or hosted services which could integrate with other components such as <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/realtime">real-time APIs</a>, <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/09/14/client-push-services-open-up-real-time-to-everyone/">real-time client push services</a> and <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/?s=%22data%20as%20a%20service%22">DaaS</a> services.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/12/21/why-client-apis-are-an-important-part-of-any-real-time-service.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/12/21/why-client-apis-are-an-important-part-of-any-real-time-service.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just been involved in a twitter conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/nickhalstead">Nick Halstead</a> of <a href="http://datasift.net">DataSift</a> on Twitter. This all started when I <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/leggetter/status/17233038429655041">tweeted</a> that I thought <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a> would be a great way of distributing data from DataSift to any web-enabled device.</p>
<p>The conversation continued:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/leggetter-nickhalstead-conversation1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The main thing here for me is Nick's point that "<strong>you just need a client-side library</strong>". This is an assumption that a lot of services make. Services tend to offer one or a number of server APIs; maybe a REST one and now luckily we are seeing a HTTP Streaming and WebSocket support. That service may then release some example code that can be used to call the web service. I see a number of problems with this mainly when it comes to HTTP Streaming and WebSockets.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/rest-api/websocket-streaming">DataSift WebSocket Streaming Docs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/rest-api/http-streaming-api">DataSift HTTP Streaming Docs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>WebSockets aren't as yet supported in enough browsers. Therefore it's not viable to purely rely on WebSocket support in any production application. So, you can't build a web application unless there is a fallback alternative. HTTP Streaming in a web browser could be a fallback (XmlHttpReqeust, XDomainRequest or Flash connections) if the server provides the necessary <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/#access-control-allow-origin-response-hea">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a> response header, the browser is new enough, or if the user has Flash installed the server serves up a crossdomain.xml file and the developer is willing to also write code to deal with all the browser types and technoloy scenarios. Then you need to deal with authentication from a web browser for some services to let you access their HTTP Streaming API. DataSift will class your connection as a 2nd class client if you don't authenticate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Authorization is not required on the streaming API. However, should you chose not to authenticate, you may be subject to stricter rate limiting and other disadvantages over an authorized user. Therefore, authorization is strongly recommended</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means is that DataSift as yet don't support real-time updates in web browser clients fully.</p>
<p>Then you need to consider other technologies like .NET, Java, C or C++ desktop applications, mobile applications on iPhone, iPad, Windows Mobile 7 or Palm using webOS. Each of these technologies requires a client API.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.datasift.net/help/kb/libraries/api-client-libraries">DataSift API Client Libraries</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-scenario"><a href="#a-scenario">A Scenario</a></h3>
<p>Say I were building a new service which focused on real-time data and delivery of that data in our custom application to desktop app, mobile apps and web apps. My service is focused on curating real-time data from different sources. My first port of call would be DataSift or Superfeedr (I'm going to leave Kwwika out of the equation here). I know these guys can deal with large volumes of data and can provide some filtering. Maybe if filtering was absolutely key I would go for DataSift (maybe <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/julien51">Julien</a> would tell me off for that).</p>
<p>Now I've made my choice and I've got all the data I want streaming through my chosen service and I start to build my client applications. If I choose to build my web application first I'm stumped as I've already explained, but let's say I want to build a Windows desktop application first. Simple, I use the HttpWebRequest object to create a HTTP Streaming connection to DataSift, follow the connection guidelines that DataSift follow (<a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api_concepts#connecting">Twitter's HTTP Streaming guidelines</a> including a backing off process and handle reconnection) and I've not got my real-time Windows desktop application.</p>
<p>I now decide to build an iPhone application so that people on the move can access my service. I need to start from scratch by writing iOS (Objective-C) code to connect to DataSift's HTTP streaming API, following the back off process and deal with reconnection. Once I've done that I move on to Windows 7 Mobile and I have to do the same again.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DataSift-not-kwwika1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You get my point.</p>
<p>Now, once DataSift becomes popular, and it will, there will be loads of open source client APIs to choose from. However, these APIs are likely to have been built by a number of different developers providing different ways of doing the same things. Some might be DataSift specific but hopefully they'll be generic HTTP Streaming libraries. At this point building my service applications will become a little easier but, in my opinion, still not as easy as it should be.</p>
<h3 id="using-kwwika"><a href="#using-kwwika">Using Kwwika</a></h3>
<p>If I were to build this service, and not exclude Kwwika, I would set up all my real-time data streaming through DataSift and write a single library, probably reusing the <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/components/kwwika-tweet-streamer">Kwwika Tweet Streamer</a> code which handles the HTTP Streaming connection and the Twitter connection guidelines, and push the data from DataSift into Kwwika. For each of my client applications I could simply download/use the relevant <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api">Kwwika API</a> (JavaScript, .NET, Silverlight, Flash, Objective-C, Java, C) to subscribe to the DataSift data on any web-enabled device. And because these APIs are are developed and maintained by Kwwika they are consistent across platforms e.g. if you've used the .NET API you will be familiar with the JavaScript API.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DataSift-just-kwwika.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>My point is that the client APIs are as important as the server APIs. A quality real-time client API adds a lot of value to the service such as handling reconnection, failover, subscription management, connection monitoring, error handling, bi-directional messaing and request batching (not relevant in this scenario). As well as real-time data distrubtion/messaging/client push this is a key part of what Kwwika offers.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of weeks we've been involved in developing a Real-Time Cricket widget. It's been a collaboration, with <a href="http://www.optasports.com/">Opta Sports</a> providing the data, Kwwika powering the real-time client push as well as doing a bit of dev on data architecture and feed parsing and <a href="http://www.matadorgroup.co.uk/">Matador Digital</a> helping us build the widget itself.</p>
<div id="ashes_3rd_test"></div>
<p><script src="http://kwwika-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/widgets/opta/cricket/opta.cricket.js"></script><br />
<script><br />
opta.cricket.widget("#ashes_3rd_test",<br />
    {<br />
        style:"scorecard",<br />
        gameDirectory:"/opta/cricket/fixtures/icc_world_cup_2011/20110330/semi_final_2"<br />
    }<br />
);<br />
</script></p>
<style>
.opta-kwwika-score { color: white; }.opta-kwwika-news p { margin-top: 10px; }<br />
</style>

<p>There's quite a bit of work gone into this widget in a short space of time and I'm really pleased with the result. I'll go into exactly how it was built in more detail in a later post but for now i'll focus on what the widget can do and be used in this post.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<p>Opta Sports have created a an <a href="http://www.optasports.com/sports/cricket/internet-and-mobile/live-scores-centre.html">overview page for the widget</a> which details the features at a higher level but I'm going to drill down a little bit deeper into the tech and explain how easily the widget can be embedded on any website.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-ball-by-ball-updates"><a href="#real-time-ball-by-ball-updates">Real-time ball-by-ball updates</a></h3>
<p>For each event that occurs within a cricket match Opta Sports generate a feed. We get this feed, parse it and push it through Kwwika and into the web page. This means that every event is displayed on the widget.</p>
<h3 id="show-either-full-scoreboard-or-simple-match-status"><a href="#show-either-full-scoreboard-or-simple-match-status">Show either full scoreboard or simple match status</a></h3>
<p>Ok, we finally get to see how you embed the widget in your page. It's simple!</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]opta.cricket.widget(&quot;#scorecard-wrapper&quot;,<br />
    {<br />
        style:&quot;scorecard&quot;,<br />
        gameDirectory:&quot;/OPTA/CRICKET/FIXTURES/AUSTRALIA_V_ENGLAND_ASHES_2010-11/20101226/4TH_TEST&quot;<br />
    }<br />
);[/code]</p>
<p>The first parameter you pass to the <em>opta.cricket.widget</em> function is a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">jQuery selector</a>. This tells the widget where it should be created. If the selector matches multiple elements then you'll get multiple widgets. You probably wouldn't want this but it's a cool trick. The widget will replace the contents of the selected element(s) so until the widget loads you can have some HTML that says the widget is loading or just some static cricket data. If the widget can't load for any reason then the contents of the element(s) won't be replaced. This won't happen though ;)</p>
<p>The second parameter is options for the widget. We have a number of options that we support but the example above shows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>style</strong>: The widget can be created in a number of forms and this option parameter indicates how the widget should be displayed:
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li><strong>scorecard:</strong> This style is the full scorecard for an innings. This displays an overview section and all batsman and bowler information.</li>
<li><strong>mini</strong>: This style is very similar to the scorecard. It displays the overview section and just the batsman and bowlers that are active.</li>
<li><strong>overview</strong>: This style shows just the overview section of the widget.</li>
<li><strong>livescores</strong>: This style just shows the current score in a smaller widget area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>gameDirectory</strong>: This identifies the Kwwika topic to request for the game and the data for this game will be displayed in the widget. The following topic is used for the 3rd test of the Australia v England Ashes 2010 to 2011 series: /OPTA/CRICKET/FIXTURES/AUSTRALIA_V_ENGLAND_ASHES_2010-11/20101216/3RD_TEST</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a few other option parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>innings</strong>: The widget defaults to displaying the latest available information. However, we cache some of the cricket data so it's possible to display the data for an earlier innings from a match by passing in an innings number.</li>
<li><strong>flashTime</strong>: When an update occurs such as a run being scored or a bowler bowling a batsman out we flash the widget. This allows you to set how long the flash will last for.</li>
<li><strong>title</strong>: This is displayed at the top of the widget if it is in the livescores style.</li>
<li><strong>topicErrorMsg</strong>: A bit techie. If you have entered a gameDirectory that doesn't exist then the widget displays an error message. This allows you to configure what that error message says. It can contain HTML.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yep, it's the real-time web. Delivered ;) Do you have any data that you want to instantly distribute to any web-enabled device? If so, <a href="http://kwwika.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
<h3 id="easy-to-customise---apply-your-own-styling-and-branding"><a href="#easy-to-customise---apply-your-own-styling-and-branding">Easy to customise - apply your own styling and branding</a></h3>
<p>Since the widget is purely HTML and we've styled it with CSS you can easily customise the widget. <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronbassett">Aaron Basset</a> of Matador Digital did a great job when I asked him to supply a few different stylesheets. He told me that he'd used <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> to generate the CSS for the widget so it was easy to create different styles. Within 15 minutes Aaron had sent 10 different styles my way. You can apply the different styles in our example pages by just changing the drop-down at the top-left of the page. My favourites are the Kill Bill or Comic styles.</p>

<p>We've classed the HTML container element for the widget and the single widget script include as lines of code which bumps this up to 3 lines. I've used a number of widgets in the past and I think we've done a great job here.</p>
<p>[code lang="html"]<br />
&lt;div id=&quot;scorecard&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />

Okay, that last line is a bit long and maybe counts as 4!</p>
<h3 id="multiple-matches-on-a-single-web-page"><a href="#multiple-matches-on-a-single-web-page">Multiple matches on a single web page</a></h3>
<p>You can call <em>opta.cricket.widget</em> as many times as you like and for each call you could pass a different game directory. That way you could easily have multiple games displayed on the same web page if you liked. You could also mix the styles of widgets that are on a web page.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-that-widget!"><a href="#i-want-that-widget!">I want that widget!</a></h2>
<p>Opta Sports specialise in high quality sports data. They have a number of sports products and this real-time cricket widget is the latest such product. Opta Sports are looking for companies who are interested in taking this widget and embedding it on their website or within their web application. If you are interested please <a href="http://kwwika.com/contact">get in touch with us</a> or or directly with Opta Sports <a href="http://www.optasports.com/sports/cricket/internet-and-mobile/live-scores-centre.html">via their cricket score centre page</a>.</p>
<p>Since the ashes are nearly at an end we will also consider allowing you to embed this widget free of charge on your website for the remaining Ashes matches. Just <a href="http://kwwika.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-the-cricket-data!"><a href="#i-want-the-cricket-data!">I want the cricket data!</a></h2>
<p>One of the things that excites us about this widget is that we are now seeing high quality sports data streaming through our servers. We've also proven that Kwwika is a fantastic distribution channel for real-time data. And we've seen that the delivery speeds between the data being captured and appearing on a web page are fantastic! We hope that this is the start of a big DAAS (Data as a Service) trend and that Kwwika can be at the forefront of it.</p>
<p>If you like the widgets but you'd love to just get hold of the raw data and build your own widget, web app, mobile app or desktop app then <a href="http://kwwika.com/contact">please get in touch</a> too.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>You can find a link to all the the live examples on <a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/opta/cricket/ashes-widget/example.html">Opta Sports - Cricket Match &amp; Events Centre demo</a> page.</p>
<p>The above examples are hard-coded to show the Ashes 2nd Test but here are the Scorecard widget links to allow you to view the data from the 3rd and 4th tests:</p>
<ul>

<p>Last but certainly not least, a bit thanks to everybody we worked with on this.</p>

<p>A big thanks to <a href="http://optasports.com/">Opta Sports</a> for working on this product with us and giving us a chance to show off our technology. Working with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alonzehavi">Alon</a> in particular has been a pleasure.</p>

<p>We'd also like to thank <a href="http://www.matadorgroup.co.uk/">Matador Digital</a> for the UI work and doing the majority of the widget functionality (I couldn't help "lending a hand" though). Dave did a great job helping us come up with the UI and Aaron never ceases to amaze me with little pieces of information that make daunting tasks seem so simple. Really appreciate your hard work guys!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We've got a potential client interested in using Kwwika on HP webOS so we've been <strong>working with them</strong> to test the Kwwika JavaScript library on a platform that we've not been directly targeting. After a problem glitch with the 64bit <a href="http://developer.palm.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;layout=page&amp;id=1788&amp;Itemid=21">webOS SDK</a> (mainly JVM and PATH problems) we got the 32bit one up and running and the a webOS emulator fired up. From there Palm have created a really nifty web IDE called <a href="http://ares.palm.com/Ares/about.html">Ares</a>. Ares communicates with the webOS emulator, which runs on <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a>, via the web browser Java plugin and it allows you to launch the application and debug it. This works surprisingly well.</p>
<div>We came across three <a href="http://leggetter.posterous.com/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-1-of">problems</a> with the Kwwika JavaScript API where we'd made assumptions that the library would be running within a web browser. We fixed this by stepping through the code with Ares debugger and soon we were connected, logged in, subscribing to data and publishing data.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>The code is super-simple since it's just a normal HTML page:</p>
<p>[gist id=732019]</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/732019"></a>And our application didn't have any UI but you can see from the log at the bottom of this screenshot that the Kwwika JavaScript library is working with webOS as expected.</p>

<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/nasdaq_logo1_opt.png" class="imgRight" />Over the past few months at PW we&#8217;ve noticed steady increase in the number of mentions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_as_a_Service">Data as a Service</a> (DaaS) and this trend looks to continue. Our <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/26/data-as-a-service-pricing-models-for-the-future-of-data/">first post</a> on the subject was by a guest author Pete Soderling who introduced us to the concept and discussed pricing models. Then we continued the theme by posting about a <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/10/26/stock-data-api-hints-at-future-of-data-as-a-service/">partnership between a stock data site and an open data platform</a>, working together to deliver a stock historical data API. The latest big move in this area sees NASDAQ creating a Data-On-Demand service accessible through a Web API.</p>
<p>This is a progressive move for NASDAQ who have previously made the data available in a much less accessible and flexible format, as <a href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid201_gci1522284,00.html">SearchCloudComputing writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The NASDAQ Data-On-Demand service will allow users to connect programmatically to NASDAQ&#8217;s massive data store instead of having to either look at it online or download giant chunks of raw data and sort it themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s really interesting to see a large finance sector organization trust the cloud. Many banks and other financial institutions seem to be holding off from a move to the cloud. The general concensus about the reason for this is that they have a concern about cloud service security. This move by NASDAQ could potentially pave the way for other similar organizations to start considering the cloud as a viable, and secure, option. However, in this case it might have been cost saving that has been a real motivating factor.</p>
<p>Also from the SearchCloudComputing story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since NASDAQ has so much historical data, the costs to store and use the data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) can add up to hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars per month; spare change from an enterprise perspective on operating costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long will it be until we start to see more financial institutions moving services to the cloud? Will the DaaS trend continue as more organizations realize the value of their data and build, or use third party services, to expose that data? And will we see a convergence with a massive trend of the past few years, the real-time web, as companies start to expose real-time data services?</p>

	I just saw a <a href="http://twitter.com/mhawksey/statuses/28697368351">tweet by @mhawksey</a> linking to a government <a href="http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=416174&amp;NewsAreaID=2">announcement</a>:
<p />

<p />
<div>And what areas will be targeted?</div>
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> Each centre will focus on a specific technology where there is a potentially large global market and a significant UK capability.

<p />
<div>Plastic Electronics! Regenerative Medicine! High Value Manufacturing!</div>
<p />
<div>No mention of software or Information Technology. When I think of high-tech I think software. I don&#39;t think hardware. Maybe that&#39;s just me?</div>
<p />
<div>Ok, there&#39;s hope yet as the areas were only identified as &quot;possibilities&quot;. What about giving some of that money to the highly innovative software services that are being developed through out the UK?</div></p>

      <title><![CDATA[CycleStreets Brings Bicycle Journey Planning to the UK]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=16170</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=16170</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/cyclestreets"><img alt="CycleStreets" src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at2251.png" class="imgRight" /></a>Cycling in the UK is not only a popular past time but and also a real commuting choice. The UK has numerous defined cycle routes and many towns and cities have designated cycling lanes and more recently London introduced a <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14808.aspx">cycling scheme</a> fondly referred to as Boris&#8217; Bikes after the current Mayor of London. Since more and more people are using a bicycle as a preferred method of transport, and with cyclists having a different selection of routes, on top of the ordinary street network, than alternative transportation methods, it makes sense for there to be a need for a bicycle journey planning web application and API.</p>
<p>The CycleStreets (<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/cyclestreets">CycleStreets API profile</a>) website <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/about/">about page</a> explains the basic premise and the target user:</p>
<blockquote><p>CycleStreets is a UK-wide cycle journey planner system, which lets you plan routes from A to B by bike. It is designed by cyclists, for cyclists, and caters for the needs of both confident and less confident cyclists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CycleStreets system is based on a Journey Planner and Photomap launched by <a href="http://www.camcycle.org.uk/">Cambridge Cycling Campaign</a> in June 2006 and is currently in beta. The web application uses map data from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and tile rendering and tile serving from <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/">OpenCycleMap</a>. The Photomap functionality lets users view and add cycling-related photos. These can then be categorising and placed in gallaries. The hope is that this will add value to the service and be useful in influencing decision-makers. The Journey Planner allows the user to plan routes, see photographs of locations on the journey and choose the fastest, quietest or most direct route.  <img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/CycleStreetsWebApp.png" alt="CycleStreets Web Application" /></p>
<p>I got in touch with Martin Lucas-Smith, a developer on CycleStreets, to find out a bit more about the <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/api/">CycleStreets API</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The API which powers the CycleStreets website is now available for mobile and potentially other uses. Its main feature is the journey planner, enabling cycle journeys to be planned upto 160km long. We&#8217;re particularly keen to see it used in Android apps and on other mobile platforms, and for people to find innovative uses for the Photomap! So if you have something related to cycling in the UK, do consider using our API to extend your app&#8217;s functionality!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The API is used directly by the CycleStreets web application, the <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/mobile/">CycleStreets for iPhone</a>, the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bike-hub-cycle-journey-planner/id391782662?mt=8">Bike Hub Cycle Journey Planner app</a>, <a href="http://www.londonbikeapp.com/">London Bike App</a>, <a href="http://www.londoncycleapp.com/">London Cycle App</a> and the list keeps on growing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/cyclestreetsiphone.png" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>Lucas-Smith is keen to try and get others involved in CycleStreets and plans to open source the code too:</p>
<blockquote><p>People are able to get involved with CycleStreets in a variety of ways &#8211; see <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/10/18/cyclestreets-brings-bicycle-journey-planning-to-the-uk/www.cyclestreets.net/getinvolved">www.cyclestreets.net/getinvolved</a> . We&#8217;d particularly welcome any help with coding of the core CycleStreets code, with donations or help with fundraising! As an example I&#8217;ve nominated Simon, our lead developer, as a <a href="http://www.talk-talk.mirror.co.uk/region-e-anglia.htm">digital hero</a> in an effort to get funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are going to continue to see the digital enabling of recreational activities, such as cycling, by more APIs like CycleStreets and it&#8217;s exciting to wait and see what will appear next.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/10/15/migrating-asp-net-membership-users-from-one-database-to-another.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/10/15/migrating-asp-net-membership-users-from-one-database-to-another.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
	The <a href="http://www.asp.net/hosting/tutorials/configuring-a-website-that-uses-application-services-cs">Configuring a Website that Uses Application Services page</a> does cover <b>Copying User Accounts from Development to Production</b> but doesn&#39;t go into all that much detail. It really skips over the topic and starts talking about the <b>ApplicationId</b> and <b>applicationName</b> problem that a lot of people have had trouble with. This problem has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/22/Always-set-the-_2200_applicationName_2200_-property-when-configuring-ASP.NET-2.0-Membership-and-other-Providers.aspx">also been covered</a> by Scott Gu back in 2006. The part it skips over is that you can actually migrate your users and applications if you use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=56e5b1c5-bf17-42e0-a410-371a838e570a&amp;displaylang=en">Database Publishing Wizard</a>. But it doesn&#39;t tell you what to do if you don&#39;t want to use the Database Publishing Wizard. Here&#39;s what I did:

<ol>
<li>In SQL Server Managment Studio right-click on your database and select &quot;Tasks -&gt; Generate Scripts...&quot;. The SQL Server Scripts Wizard dialog will appear.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Next&quot;, select the database with the Application Services, <a href="http://asp.net">ASP.NET</a> Membership tables installed and click &quot;Next&quot; again</li>
<li>In the &quot;Choose Script Options&quot; dialog change the &quot;Script Create&quot; option to False and change &quot;Script Data&quot; to True. The click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
<li>In the &quot;Choose Object Types&quot; dialog select just &quot;Tables&quot; and click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
<li>In the &quot;Choose Tables&quot; dialog select all the tables with a &quot;aspnet_&quot; prefix. In my dialog this went from &quot;aspnet_Applications&quot; to &quot;aspnet_WebEvent_Events&quot;. Click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
<li>You can then generate the script which you will then run on the destination database to a variety of destinations including a new query window in SQL Server Management Studio or a .sql text file by clicking &quot;Finish&quot; (potentially twice).</li>
</ol>
<div>The next steps simply involve running SQL Server Management Studio and connecting to you destination database and running the generated script against it. This obviously assumes that you have the Application Services installed already.</div>
<p />
<div>When I ran my generated SQL on the destination server I did get a few &quot;Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint&quot; errors. To be honest I just ignored them since my application and users had been successfully inserted into the necessary tables and I could login using the expected credentials.</div>
<p />
<div>If you do have any questions about this please just post a comment.</div>
</p>

      <title><![CDATA[East Coast Trains drop free WIFI. Time to consider flying?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/10/13/east-coast-trains-drop-free-wifi-time-to-consider-flying.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/10/13/east-coast-trains-drop-free-wifi-time-to-consider-flying.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/wphmXaZbMb7El2E99rkbMvq4av3Y6SP9l4bkadlanyHD8EjixkNVYDIFS2N3/EastCoastLogin.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/4MjTZrc3ZhFlSXQEAa5aBkJQsn4yWNFLVUkvZP83j7BRN9iGCugcLXzqofcv/EastCoastLogin.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="365" /></a></p>
<p>WIFI is absolutely essential for those working on the move. This is one reason why free WIFI is popping up all over the place. Cafes, public places with nearby shops and even petrol stations (service stations) are offering free WIFI as a way of enticing customers to use their services or visit their premises. This trend is set to continue. Surely.</p>
<p />
<div>Today I'm making my fortnightly trip to London from Dundee. I normally get an East Coast mainline train direct from Dundee to London but today, since I need to be in London earlier, I got a Scotrail train from Dundee to Edinburgh and then caught the 08:00 East Coast train to London. I've just set up my laptop to be presented with a brand new login screen and to my surprise only 15 minutes of free WIFI.</div>
<div>
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><p>We've made a significant investment to improve our on-board Wi-Fi. To ensure our new service is faster and more reliable, we're introducing a payment system for Standard Class passengers &ndash; however, every Standard Class passenger will get 15 minutes free Wi-Fi per journey. On-board Wi-Fi is free to all First Class passengers. In Standard Class passengers get 15 minutes free usage and extra usage costs &pound;4.95 per hour and &pound;9.95 for 24 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p />
<div>Let me start by saying I can't even login. When I try to login I get a connection error. Not a good start. Even if I could login to the new system to get my 15 minutes of free WIFI I don't think I would bother. Over the past 7 months I've chosen to make my journey to London via train as it offers a much more&nbsp;pleasant experience than the faffing around you have to do when flying - driving out to an airport, parking, getting a bus into the airport terminal, checking in, get through security (shoes off, belt off, laptop out of bag, feel me up, fuck off!) and then&nbsp;cramming&nbsp;yourself into a plane for an hour before having to then pick up your hold luggage and make your way, via train, into London. During these 7 months the WIFI service on the East Coast trains has been average to say the least. Quite frequently you can't connect - no change there then. Other times it's unbelievably slow. Maybe the "significant investment" will improve this but they've not made a good start.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>The other major benefit from travelling by train is that it offers a comfortable enough experience for you to actually get some work done. I'm a Real-Time <strong>Web </strong>Software Evangelist (today anyway) so clearly connection to the Internet is pretty high on my list of requirements for any working environment. Up until today East Cost trains offered this. 15 minutes of free WIFI won't do for my 5+ hour journey.</div>
<p />
<div>It looks like I'm either going to have to book early and try and get a cheap first class ticket, stump up &pound;9.95 for standard class WIFI access or think about flying. Yuck!</div>
<p />
<div>How have I posted this? Using network tethering. Maybe this is the way forward?</div></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm looking forward to Gary Vaynerchuk's new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0061914185?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0061914185">The Thank You Economy</a>. I know what's going to be in it. But, I'm still going to buy it. This is the point that Gary will make in the book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0061914185?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0061914185"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/UQryurjc0PicLEOcb5ueImDe3ZMxRgLSTCQX4FCPKqqqHGSAzW7zFpOFJPU9/TheThankYouEconomy.jpg" width="300" height="300" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>I know what Gary means by "The Thank You Economy" as he's spoken about it loads of times before. He's used his last book,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0061914177?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0061914177">Crush It!: Why Now is the Time to Cash in on Your Passion</a>, as an example of this quite a few times. People who already go to <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary's blog</a> regularly will have heard a lot of the content contained within Crush It! before they even read it. The book contains a lot of what he talks about all the time. So, why did people still buy his book? To say "Thank You".</p>
<p>But I bet very few people bought the book to say thank you and didn't read it. I also bet that very few people who bought multiple copies of the book (Gary ran a promotion) to give to friends or family did so thinking the book didn't offer value. They wouldn't have bought just anything to say "thank you". They knew what the book would contain and they believed it had value. They could read the book to remind themselves of the things Gary had already covered; to come up with new ideas based on what had already been said.<br />
My point? Some people will say "thank you" and expect nothing in return. Others, and I still think most, will say "thank you" but still want something for it.</p>
<p>Another good example of this might be music. A lot of people still illegally download music. For some that'll be the end of it; they have the music and that's it. Some people will illegally download the music and if they like it they'll buy the album. Why would you buy an album not knowing if you like what's on it? I get that. If they like it they may even buy the CD and never take it out of it's packaging - as a "thank you" to the music artist. Some people say "thank you" and don t' expect anything in return. Others still want something in return.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moneydashboard.com"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/EORcE1tmXVtA28rKbF7u1WSfNMnSSmzzM7A1SyxydhRDTfEzebDvUPln3P0Z/MoneyDashboard.png" width="270" height="35" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>What actually got me thinking about this was Issue 2 of the Dashboard Digest newsletter from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard</a>&nbsp;by Gavin LittleJohn.&nbsp;Money Dashboard do offer a really exciting service. They allow you to view all your finances in one place and also allow you to analyse your spending and offer a <a href="http://www.moneydashboard.com/benefits">host of other benefits</a>. If you put in the effort with the site you really can get a lot of benefit. After this I'm going to start using it more often. Anyway,&nbsp;it was this paragraph from the newsletter in particular that got me thinking about The Thank You Economy:</p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><p>Please remember that Money Dashboard is a free service. We would like to keep it that way. You can support us in our mission to make people more financially savvy, by remembering to buy your financial products through our &ldquo;Ways to Save&rdquo; section. We will take a marketing fee from the product provider as our income.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the above paragraph you'll see that Money Dashboard make money by taking a marketing fee from product providers. This will be in the form of direct advertising revenue and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing">affiliation</a>. They are asking their users to say "thank you" by using their "Ways to Save" section. Some of the people that are getting great value from the Money Dashboard service will use this section. Others, and I have to admit I fall into this category, won't use this section because I don't believe they are offering a full view of the market, although they do refer you to comparison sites, and I'd rather get the affiliate fee myself. If this makes me sound like a meanie then let me explain.</p>
<p>People who use affiliate programs get money if they refer a user to a website (e.g. Amazon links to Crush It! and The Thank You Economy above) and that&nbsp;referral&nbsp;ends up in that user purchasing something from that website. As explained, this is one of the ways that Money Dashboard will make money. The reason I probably wouldn't use the Money Dashboard Ways to Save section is that the affiliate fees for the sorts of financial products referred to (Insurance, savings accounts, credit cards etc.) are very high. For example, last year the return on referring somebody to sign up for a More Than insurance policy was &pound;50 (GBP). Say you signed up for your years car insurance, home insurance and another service with a good return, say broadband, then the affiliate, in this case Money Dashboard, would receive around &pound;150 (GBP) affiliate fees. Now, Money Dashboard is a good service but is it worth &pound;150 (GBP) a year that you could potentially take yourself? I don't think it is.</p>
<p>How do you get the affiliate fee yourself? You use a service such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.topcashback.co.uk/">Top Cashback</a> or <a href="http://www.quidco.com/">QuidCo</a> (who <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/leggetter/statuses/25782147779">I'm actually getting a bit annoyed with</a>).</p>
<p>The other option available to Money Dashboard is to make people pay for the service. This, of course, is a massive barrier to entry/sign-up.</p>
<p>There is a third option and I actually passed my opinion on to Money Dashboard about this in a survey months ago. That option is to give some of the affiliate fee back to the user. Money Dashboard could offer a service similar to Top Cashback or QuidCo. They could even partner with one of them. If I could do my own research to find the best deal on home or car insurance using one of the many market comparison companies (again, why would you click through via their website when they get the whole affiliate fee) and then log into Money Dashboard, find the insurance company in their affiliate directory listing and click-through to make my purchase. Money Dashboard would get the affiliate fee from the insurance company <strong>and</strong>&nbsp;give you a large percentage of that fee in return for the click-through. This way they get a "thank you" commission and you also make something out of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Thank You Economy</strong> does exist but you've more than likely got to give a bit back in return for that thanks.</p>

<p>I was just looking at my web stats and was presented with a Chrome advertisement at the top of the page. But I&#39;m already using Chrome so what&#39;s the point in showing me an advert for it. That&#39;s just a wasted advert impression.</p>
<p />

<div><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> uses JavaScript to display each banner and there are a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=javascript+browser+sniffing#hl=en&amp;expIds=17259,17291,24683,25532,25941,26579,26621,26714,26736,26751&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=javascript+browser+detection&amp;cp=20&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;source=hp&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=javascript+browser+d&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=a10a6dd23ac37a99">tonne of ways</a> you can use JavaScript to detect what web browser the page is rendered in.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
	First, it's worth having a listen to the <a href="http://www.socialmediawhitenoise.com/2010/09/13/46-the-scrambled-egg-show/">Social Media White Noise Podcast episode</a>.
<p />
<div>You can also view <a href="http://www.socialmediawhitenoise.com/2010/09/13/46-the-scrambled-egg-show/comment-page-1/#comment-716">my comment</a> on that page but since I wrote quite a bit I thought I'd copy it here:</div>
<p />
<div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><p> I've an opinion about the SEO point. Part of that is based on an annoyance at so many companies claiming to be SEO companies and "experts". The annoyance is based on knowing that some companies do very little for their money e.g. just update a report template document with the new client details and do a couple of hours research and then charge hundreds of pounds for that document. They have managed to market themselves so well as SEO experts by simply jumping on the bandwagon first and by doing this have managed to make money purely on the basis that companies are blind to what SEO is and that they must have their website SEO'd. Big corporations are terrible in this regard. The same SEO companies are now offering social media services simply because companies now feel they must have a social media presence - another bandwagon opportunity. They charge for setting up Facebook pages, Twitter accounts and blogs but do little else for the client when what they should do is teach clients how to use social media or offer a full managed service which will ultimately transition to an in-house service. The long term full managed services will never deliver any quality as the turn over of staff at big SEO, Digital Marketing or Social Media companies is too large so the service will never be any better than manufactured blog posts from paid bloggers and streams of nonsense from managing twitter accounts. Sorry, rant over.</p></blockquote>

However, eventually the Google Algorithm will update, the search results orders will change, the SEO companies will need to do more research and training (maybe at Google), the clients will need to pay more money to have more SEO applied and the search results ordering will update again. And so on.</p></blockquote>

I believe this is largely thanks to the natural weighting applied to social media.</p></blockquote></div></p>

      <title><![CDATA[XMPP PubSub or PubSubHubbub for real-time server push?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/technology/2010/09/17/xmpp-pubsub-or-pubsubhubbub-for-real-time-server-push.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/technology/2010/09/17/xmpp-pubsub-or-pubsubhubbub-for-real-time-server-push.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In case you hadn't noticed,&nbsp;<a href="http://leggetter.posterous.com/hit-roond-around-the-heed-head-by-a-faash-fis">when I'm not getting hit by flying trout</a>, I like to think of myself as a bit of <a href="/">a real-time web guy</a>. However, there's one thing I'd like clarification on, and I'm confident somebody will be able to shed some light on this:</p>
<p />

<p><strong>What are the differences between </strong><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html"><strong>XMPP PubSub</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/pubsubhubbub/"><strong>PubSubHubbub</strong></a><strong> and in what situations should each be used?</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p />

<p>I do think I know some details about this but I’d like what I think I know to be confirmed or indeed corrected.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>My knowledge of the real-time web, and specifically real-time client push, comes from working for <a href="http://www.caplin.com/">Caplin Systems</a> who pioneered building Comet servers around 10 years ago. From working with Caplin Systems and with Comet servers I’ve gained an understanding of how connections are made using different technologies and maintained in different scenarios. I also believe that I have a good understanding of what the best connection method is to deliver real-time data whether the delivery be from <strong>server to client using real-time client push</strong> or <strong>server to server using PubSubHubub or XMPP PubSub</strong>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Persistent Connections</span>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Unless the frequency of data updates is very low, and if you want to truly deliver data in real-time, the best type of connection is a persistent one.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>As well as a persistent connection being able to deliver data faster it also means that your data subscriber does not have to handle a new HTTP connection for each piece of data it receives. This can actually be a really big thing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>As part of building <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a> I wrote a demo which integrated the real-time server push capabilities of <a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr</a> with the real-time client push capabilities of Kwwika to build a <a href="http://superfeedr.kwwika.com">real-time news reader</a> (RTNR) (<a href="/2010/08/26/real-time-news-reader-shows-off-push-to-browser.html">blog article</a>). In order to receive updates from Superfeedr I had to implement a publisher-subscriber outside of the Kwwika infrastructure. I decided to write a <a href="http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub">PubSubHubbub</a> implementation in ASP.NET so that I could use a few other <a href="http://github.com/Kwwika/Kwwika-Components">.NET Kwwika components</a> to easily integrate with Kwwika.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>So, each time Superfeedr has an update for the RTNR it establishes a HTTP connection to the RTNR PubSubhubbub server and sends the update which is then parsed and pushed into Kwwika to be distributed to subscribing web clients. If the RTNR is subscribing to something that is updating really frequently (such as “google” using <a href="http://superfeedr.com/documentation#track">Superfeedr track</a>) then that can mean the RTNR server has to handle a lot of HTTP requests. Since I am running the demo on a small Amazon Windows instance running IIS it doesn’t take all that long, under a heavy load, for the server to stop responding.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>There must be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Real-time client push</span>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>By way of a comparison let’s first take a look at real-time client push.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Before WebSockets provided the simplest way (but as yet not the most reliable since the WebSocket standard is not set in stone and isn’t supported cross-browser) to achieve real-time push to a web browser the best connection method was to maintain a streaming and persistent HTTP connection from the publisher to the client subscriber (using an IFRAME, XMLHttpRequest or XDomainRequest). The persistent connection means that the connection has already been established so as soon as the publisher has any new data for the subscriber it can instantly be pushed to it. This means that the data can be delivered to the web browser as close to real-time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Real-time Server Push</span>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p><strong>PubSubHubbub</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>PubSubHubbub turns things on it’s head in comparison to real-time client push (it actually uses HTTP as it was designed and it’s HTTP streaming that uses things in reverse. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Ajax">Reverse Ajax</a>.). In this case the publisher still pushes the new data to the subscriber but it does it using a HTTP request. The problem with this is that for each push a new HTTP connection needs to be established and the data then needs to be transferred. Establishing a connection takes time and resources so clearly a single persistent connection is a better solution. This is where I think XMPP PubSub is a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p><strong>XMPP PubSub</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>If you need your data to be delivered in truly real-time (or as close to real-time as web technology will allow) then you have to use a persistent connection between the publisher and the subscriber. It’s my understanding that since XMPP was developed as an <strong>instant</strong> messaging protocol that it uses a persistent connection.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Conclusion</span>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Here are things as I see them:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want your data in real-time you should use a persistent connection between the publisher and subscriber.</li>
<li>If you are making a server to server subscription to data that doesn't update all that often&nbsp;and instant real-time doesn't matter&nbsp;then PubSubHubbub is fine.</li>
<li>If you are making a server to server subscription to data that updates very frequently then you need to use a persistent connection and XMPP PubSub is a must.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to also consider is if you are subscribing to multiple sources which update frequently then maintaining a persistent connection to each of those sources, assuming they even allow you to, takes a considerable amount of effort and potentially resource. This is where a service like Superfeedr comes in to its own. They manage the subscriptions and connections to the sources for you which means you only need to maintain one persistent connection to Superfeedr. They do all the heavy lifting so you don't have to.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=15331</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/4011035061/"><img src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/stopwatch.jpg" alt="Real-time" title="Real-time" width="100" height="75" class="imgRight" /></a>The number of services offering <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=realtime">real-time APIs</a> is slowly but surely expanding and it looks like we&#8217;re going to have to add quite a few more. Since the start of the year a new type of service has started to appear&#8211;client push services, which help developers include real-time updates in their web apps.</p>
<p>Real-time client push APIs have actually been around for quite a while (around 10 years) as they are shipped with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet servers</a> but only recently have these been moved into the cloud and offered as a service. The service flavour of these APIs give the developer the ability to instantly push information from their web server, through their chosen push service and into a web browser viewing their website.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/scrabbly.jpg" alt="Scrabb.ly -- real-time multi-player word game" title="Scrabb.ly -- real-time multi-player word game" width="578" height="342" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15374" /></p>
<p>Real-time client push is intended to replace the previous pull, or polling, mechanism that has been used for many years to mimic live data on a website. Using push via a dedicated Comet server is generally more resource efficient than polling a web server, and by using a service the resource load and complexity involved in setting up and running a Comet service is completely taken away from the developer&#8217;s considerations. This means that the web server is under much less strain, the developer can concentrate on building a killer real-time application and the website user gets the benefit of a truly real-time experience.</p>
<p>These services have only recently started to pop up due to a number of technology advancements. To be able to use a real-time client push service the web browser needs to be able to maintain a persistent connection back to the web server so that the web server can push information to it as soon as it becomes available. This has been achievable for a number of years via what some developer have labelled as &#8220;hacks&#8221; but is now easier than it has ever been. Most of the new services use the JavaScript <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets">WebSocket</a> object to achieve this and fallback to using Flash if WebSockets are not supported by the browser.</p>
<p>The web browser also needs to be able to maintain a <em>cross domain</em> connection from the JavaScript code running in the website to the service e.g. a connection from blog.programmableweb.com to www.example.com. In older browsers cross domain connections were not allowed but the introduction of client access policy files (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html">crossdomain.xml</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc197955(VS.95).aspx">clientaccesspolicy.xml</a>) and more recently the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-access-control-20080912/#access-control-allow-origin">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a> HTTP header have made cross domain calls from JavaScript possible (You can find more information and a demo of this in action <a href="/2010/03/12/making-cross-domain-javascript-requests-using-xmlhttprequest-or-xdomainrequest.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>All of the real-time client push services have adopted a data <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe">publisher subscriber model</a> with the web server code generally acting as the data publisher and the JavaScript code running in the web browser acting as the data subscriber. Subscriptions are made to a channel (or topic), that either exists or will be created, within the service and are identified by a name e.g. &#8220;my_channel&#8221; or &#8220;/PW/CHAT&#8221;. The publishers then simply publish data to that channel or topic using a service API and the information is instantly received by all subscribers, again via an API.</p>
<p>The real-time client push services that we know of at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://beaconpush.com/">Beacon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hookbox.org/">Hookbox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kwwika.com/">Kwwika</a> (disclosure: author is a founder)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pubnub.com/">PubNub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pusherapp.com/">Pusher</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.frozenmountain.com/websync/">WebSync</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And some examples of their use include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/26/real-time-news-reader-shows-off-push-to-browser/">A real-time news reader</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pubnub.com/blog/facebook-meh-button">A Facebook &#8220;meh&#8221; button</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.startupmonkeys.com/2010/09/building-a-scrabble-mmo-in-48-hours/">Interactive games</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/ReplayWorldCup2010/">Real-time sports statistics</a> (requires HTML5 support)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also check out the demos on each of the services websites.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/meh-button.jpg" alt="The real-time &#039;meh&#039; button" title="The real-time &#039;meh&#039; button" width="457" height="136" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15373" /></p>
<p>Real-time is already a big topic and users are starting to demand data and results as fast as possible. There is also the expectation that they should be informed as soon as new data is available or the existing data changes. Google are already pressing ahead with new real-time advancements such as <a href="http://www.google.com/realtime">Google Real-Time search</a> (which actually <a href="/2010/08/27/google-realtime-search-isnt-real-time.html">uses polling</a>) and <a href="http://www.google.com/instant/">Google Instant</a> but the good news is that with the availability of real-time client push services any developer can now add real-time to their website.</p>
<p>Let us know if you are interested in finding out more about these real-time client push APIs and services and we&#8217;ll cover each one in more detail.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I was out with my friend. We&#39;d had a couple of pints at the <a href="http://www.taychreggan-hotel.co.uk/">Taychreggan</a> and decided to head into Broughty Ferry, near Dundee. On the way along Dundee Road I got hit, around the head, with a fish. It hurt. It wasn&#39;t a small fish. It&#39;s probably a mackerel (really not sure) weighing a few pounds. It jolted my neck. It bounced off of my neck and head and hit my friend.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1781"></a><br />
Now, because it&#39;s two guys of 31 it&#39;s funny. We can deal with it. We can probably see the funny side of it. If it were were an old couple, and the fish hit an old lady, it would not be funny. It could actually have caused some damage.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to find out who this was. I don&#39;t want them to get in too much trouble. I want them to volunteer to go into stocks and get pelted with faash guts. I&#39;d laugh and I&#39;m sure I could get a few quid for a charity.  <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/Cg8A5uV7XRLVceFGAmfRBu5KSnK6ELKklhNRexJuZcTqdgJYpojnBGMA9Lan/Photo2493.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/BTF8BNyevPI3OBE3x1l89XXfl0sb86uIl37fYqMZ5wULEK0KwAMjqoOsqMlC/Photo2493.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="667" /></a><br />

      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons FourSquare is popular is because you can get awards or badges for your check-ins. Would it be of interest to anybody if you could get badges for your tweets? Some ideas for badges:
<ul>
<li> The stalker badge - following more than X users</li>
<li>The noise badge - Tweeting more than X times in the past hour</li>
<li>The chatty badge - replying to X users in the past hour</li>
<li>The profanity badge - swearing more than X times in your past X tweets</li>
<li>The Romani badge - tweeting from more than x locations</li>
<li>The greedy guts badge - tweeting more than x times about food</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you think of some other badges? Would Twitter badges and awards interest you? </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Just listening to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.socialmediawhitenoise.com/">Social Media White Noise</a> podcast and really enjoying it.<br />
I got distracted by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foursquare-api/browse_thread/thread/1a1683954077caab">something else</a> and then tuned back into the podcast. They were talking about taking digital media consumption away from the computer, which really interests me, and I wanted to jump back to the start of that part of the podcast. I couldn't.</p>
<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-08-31/AAprIerDsqzCByiybrwGfpgxkAJlHczdttIaftcHxHAHHBfrztubJejcjeAr/FeedburnerPodcastPlayer.png.scaled1000.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-08-31/AAprIerDsqzCByiybrwGfpgxkAJlHczdttIaftcHxHAHHBfrztubJejcjeAr/FeedburnerPodcastPlayer.png.scaled500.png" width="500" height="119" /></a></p>
<p>Is there a podcast player that lets the podcast author define time slices that cover certain topics? Can this be published as part of the RSS feed so all MP3/Podcast players can use this information?</p>

<p>Google have released a <a href="http://www.google.com/realtime?esrch=RealtimeLaunch::Experiment">real-time search site</a> aimed at showing search results as it happens. The disappointing thing is that although I&#39;m sure that the results are instantly updated on the server they are not instantly updated in the web browser - they are still polling for new results. This means that the instant you get your search results back that the information is out of date. If a new result comes in between the poll requests then you won&#39;t get that update until the next poll.</p>
<p><b>The experience that this delivers isn&#39;t real-time!</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67P4L320100826">news of the real-time search site was published on Reuters</a> and I was really surprised to see no comment about this at all. They&#39;ve clearly just reported the news and not commented on it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to keep on posting about these annoying stories, products and services until people start treating real-time as real-time. Polling is <b>not</b> real-time. Push <b>is</b> real-time!</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=14457</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/superfeedr"><img class="imgRight" style="float: right;" src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at1987.png" alt="Superfeedr API" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/kwwika"><img class="imgRight" style="float: right;" src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at2394.png" alt="Kwwika API" /></a>With the real-time web being claimed by some to be one of the core components of Web 3.0 it’s unsurprising that we are seeing more <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=realtime">real-time APIs</a> and real-time mashups being developed. One mashup has just been created using Kwwika and Superfeedr to demonstrate how two real-time platforms can be integrated to create a <a href="http://superfeedr.kwwika.com/">real-time news reader application</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/superfeedr">Superfeedr</a> allows a developer to subscribe to any RSS feed and receive real-time notifications when a change is made to that feed. This is done either using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a> or by polling the source if a push notification system is not available. More recently Superfeedr <a href="http://blog.superfeedr.com/track/filter/xmpp/pubsubhubbub/track/">introduced the ability to track keywords</a> within all the feeds that they are subscribing to. Once Superfeedr has an update it delivers it to your system via its API.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/kwwika">Kwwika</a> (disclosure: author is a founder) is a relatively new platform used for distributing data between any number of systems or applications in real-time. They also provide <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/api">APIs in a number of technologies</a> including JavaScript, which means they make it easy to instantly push real-time updates into a web browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rjb5lNcAFWQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rjb5lNcAFWQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" />&lt;/embed&gt;</object></p>
<p>The Kwwika Superfeedr demo application gives the user the ability to subscribe to any RSS feed or track any keyword in real-time from within a web application by combining Superfeedr’s RSS subscription and keyword tracking functionality and Kwwika’s real-time web browser push to build what can be described as a real-time news reader.</p>
<p>The application has been developed using ASP.NET MVC and JavaScript and the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/ASP.NET-MVC-PubSubHubbub-Subscriber/tree/Kwwika-Superfeedr-Demo">source code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/www.programmableweb.com/category/all/news?p=14267</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/esri-arcgis-javascript"><img src="http://www.programmableweb.com/images/apis/at869.png" alt="ESRI ArcGIS JavaScript" class="imgRight" /></a>Most of the time we write about mapping, it admittedly includes Google Maps (we list over <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/google-maps/mashups">2000 Google Maps mashups</a>). However, <a href="http://esri.com/">ESRI</a>, the biggest supplier of geographic tools for the enterprise, has made huge strides this year with its tools, including its own web mapping platform, <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/esri-arcgis-javascript">ESRI ArcGIS JavaScript API</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year ESRI <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/releases/10_2qtr/arcgis10-download.html">released ArcGIS Server 10</a> and in the the past few months a stream of associated updates and new releases have been announced including version 2.0 of their <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/arcgisserver/archive/2010/06/29/ArcGIS-APIs-for-JavaScript-and-Flex_3A00_-Version-2.0-now-final_2100_.aspx">JavaScript, Flex</a> and <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/silverlightwpf/">Silverlight/WPF</a> APIs. ESRI has also <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/arcgisserver/archive/2010/08/02/Build-applications-for-iOS-using-the-ArcGIS-API-for-Javascript.aspx">announced the release</a> of a compact ArcGIS for JavaScript version designed for building applications where slower Internet speeds and network latency is an issue, such as mobile phones. They also plan to release a native iPhone API (ArcGIS API for iOS), which is slated for the third quarter of 2010, and an ArcGIS for Windows Phone API down for mid-August as part of version 2.1 API releases.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">
<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/esri-arcgis-javascript"><img src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/arcgis-ios1-158x300.jpg" alt="ArcGIS for iOS" title="ArcGIS for iOS" width="158" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to hear news of ArcGIS Server instances in the cloud, coupled with the new mappings APIs,&#8221; <a href="http://gisconsultancy.com/blog/about">Rob Dunfey</a>, who has previously worked at ESRI and now works at Shell, said of the new tools. &#8220;We can start to deliver easy to use apps which answer business problems with a geo component. For example, the iPhone app for the CEO which downloads local sales stats as they move from site to site.&#8221;</p>
<p>The version 2.0 API release adds new functionality and exposes a number of new features available in ArcGIS Server 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>A features service which expose access to vector feature geometries and attributes.</li>
<li>Geometry service updates to facilitate Web editing.</li>
<li>Time aware layers to allow you to query or display time-aware layers using a particular slice of time.</li>
<li>Network analysis.</li>
<li>Bing Maps support updates.</li>
<li>Geocoding updates.</li>
<li>Mapping enhancements.</li>
<li>Built-in support for touch gestures in the JavaScript API.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of features see the What&#8217;s New sections of the guides for <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/help/arcgis_server_dotnet_help/index.html#//00930000000m000000.htm">ArcGIS Server 10</a>, <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/help/jshelp_start.htm#jshelp/new_v20.htm">ArcGIS for JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/flex/help/index.html#whats_new.htm%20">ArcGIS API for Flex</a> and <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/silverlight/help/?Whats_new.htm">ArcGIS API for Microsoft Silverlight / WPF</a>.</p>
<p>The ESRI mapping APIs, which are <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/07/31/is-free-enough-for-esri-to-gain-web-mapping-traction/">freely available</a>, differentiate themselves from the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/mapping">plethora of consumer focused mapping APIs</a> out there in their depth of GIS analysis they support, their ability to ask complex questions of spatial proximity and topology. However, to access this extra functionality on your own data you need to buy a license.</p>
<p>The implications of all these APIs means that the accessibility to commercial-grade GIS technology is much greater and as developers become more familiar with GIS they could potentially start bidding for development projects that were previously only accessible to GIS development houses. It also means that platforms and devices that were previously only used by consumers can potentially be used in the field.</p>
<p>With platforms such as the Web (JavaScript, Silverlight and Flex), desktop (WPF and Flex using Air) and mobile (JavaScript, Silverlight for Windows Phone and iOS) covered, and with an extra level of GIS functional, ESRI appears to have everything in place to continue being the go-to company for GIS map-based application development.</p>

Just had a little idea for a website/web application that allows you to check when you are due to upgrade your mobile phone and a few other things. Something probably exists but here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the details of your mobile phone contract and the site then informs you, probably via email, when you are due an upgrade from your mobile phone provider.</li>
<li>If an offer comes up to upgrade early then it could let you know.</li>
<li>It could also monitor offers from your provider to make sure you are getting the most of your contract.</li>
<li>When you are due an upgrade it could help you find similar tarrifs on other mobile networks (I'm sure this is already available from a number of websites).</li>
</ul>
<p>An important point about this service would need to be that your details would not be shared with any mobile providers unless you specifically asked for it to. I hate getting phone calls from people saying "your contract is about to run out...". I like to do the investigating myself and I also find that the information that these people have is out of date. An email is much less obtrusive and since it was set up by you in the first place it's much more likely to have the correct information.</p>
<p>I've had a check and AmIDueAnUpgrade.com, DueAnUpgrade and AmIDueAnUpgradeYet.com are available. They're probably not that catchy but they'd match what people search for.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We live in a flat that was previously occupied by Jo's Grandparents. One of the things we do occasionally is sort out a room or cupboard. Today I'm tidying up a room for a friend to move in whilst he's finishing his University course.</p>
<p>I've already tweeted a number of times about a metal bed that I've had to dismantle. This most recent find isn't all that interesting to look at but when you see a label that details where it was manufactured, and then find that place on Google maps to see the place has clearly completely changed, it becomes interesting.</p>

<p>This piece of&nbsp;furniture&nbsp;is just a table on wheels (I'm sure it has a better name) and it was built by Le Grest &amp; Co. at 58 Fairfield Street SW18. The place in in Wandsworth and was most probably a place where a lot of manufacturing companies set up. But as we move to a tertiary economy these places are torn down and replaced with offices, shops and/or flats.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Plotting tweets in real-time using Smoothie Charts and Kwwika]]></title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/plotting-tweets-in-real-time-using-smoothie-c</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I noticed a tweet today about real-time JavaScript charts and couldn't resist having a play. The charts are call <a href="http://smoothiecharts.org/">Smoothie Charts</a> and have been developed by <a href="http://joewalnes.com/">Joe Walnes</a>. You can read the blog post where he announced the release of them <a href="http://joewalnes.com/2010/08/10/introducing-smoothie-charts/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The demos that I've seen don't use real-time data so I thought I would create a small demo using real-time tweets being pushed through Kwwika. I updated the Kwwika TweetStreamer component (which I must get around to putting in GitHub) to push through updates from some popular hashtags including #nowplaying, #news, #tech and a few others and then wrote a bit of code to count the number of tweet updates over an interval and push that value into a Smoothie chart. The result looks like this (Smoothie charts use Canvas so only work in some browsers. I've tested this demo in Firefox and Chrome):</p>
<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/XGJM92hzwVJon8G7UYu9VoIu8Ncy5AoVYCQyMPtxFEBOL7wNI0ZgzxFjoRe6/smoothie-charts-kwwika-demo.png.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/PaXOMHgzq7ZlJRSoWUekNYeXTrBMOcrMokg1wVHAwhV2ABdjYPtNgJSWqHGe/smoothie-charts-kwwika-demo.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the <a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/javascript-examples/smoothie-twitter-charting/">Smoothie Twitter Real-Time Charting demo using Kwwika</a> here:&nbsp;<a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/javascript-examples/smoothie-twitter-charting/">http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/javascript-examples/smoothie-twitter-charting/</a></p>
<p>I've got the Smoothie chart showing the number of updates for each twitter hashtag, a table showing the count and a list of the tweets at the bottom.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/kwwika/javascript-examples/tree/master/smoothie-twitter-charting/">code is in GitHub</a> so feel free to fork/download and have a play yourself. You can run the code on <strong>http://localhost</strong> but in order to get the code to work on your own website you'll need to register with Kwwika and get in touch to let us know you want access to the real-time Twitter hashtag topics.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: We found a bug in the Smoothie library which&nbsp;<a href="http://joewalnes.com/">Joe Walnes</a>&nbsp;promptly fixed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">One thing we've noticed is that the Smoothie chart stops working and throws an exception and as yet we've not been able to work out what the problem is due to lack of time. It's probably something to do with not getting any updated values in a TimeSeries. This is what the exception look like in Firebug:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/Vp23p7cm97EFrfOilESyaIbwqzm7309thB9Qqs0HPIlHiltIiy6mQsUKd2G7/smoothie-error.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/aqZ5qseaLq9M5W2QYP0vXoB3VcFpmZY4pTfQZ0e3CFp3VNffBo6thTOLQL1u/smoothie-error.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="54" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If anybody can work out what the problem is please let us know. Failing that we'll look into it when we can.</span></p>

      <title><![CDATA[The benefits of Real-Time Push-Once]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/08/12/the-benefits-of-real-time-push-once.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/08/12/the-benefits-of-real-time-push-once.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There's so much excitement about real-time push technologies that quite often, in fact almost always, the benefits of using push are overlooked, forgotten, or simply not known. The technology excites programmers who want to use it, want to know how it works or want to write their own push framework, user experience (UX) professionals who understand how this paradigm shift will massively benefit users, general technologists who can see how the addition of such technology can improve an application or product and entrepreneurs who have the vision to see ground breaking ways of using push.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1325"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-understood-benefits"><a href="#the-understood-benefits">The understood benefits</a></h3>
<p>The cost and resource benefits that real-time push bring start to be considered when the excitement of the technology dies down and you start talking in detail about using a Cloud Platform as a Service (PAAS) such as Kwwika. Kwwika provides the more obvious benefit of <strong>allowing anybody to publish and add real-time data</strong> to any web page, web application, Rich Internet Application (RIA), desktop or service application and <strong>share information</strong> between all these and from a number of different sources. The first thoughts of resource and cost saving are when you start to consider that by using a service you don't need to <strong>buy servers to host your real-time push servers</strong>, you don't need to <strong>spend time and effort installing, setting up and learning how to use the software</strong>, you don't need to worry about <strong>maintaining the software and handling upgrades</strong> and you don't need to worry about <strong>how you deal with scaling your servers</strong> to meet increased demand as well as keeping resource usage to a minimum during lean spells. Kwwika offers all the benefits of a hosted scalable service, but for real-time push streaming as a service. This means you can concentrate on building your application, developing your product or service and winning business.</p>

<h3 id="the-benefits-of-real-time-push-once"><a href="#the-benefits-of-real-time-push-once">The benefits of real-time push-once</a></h3>
<p>The best way to understand one of the fundamental, but as yet hidden, benefits of Kwwika, and ultimately <strong>real-time push-once</strong>, is through an example:</p>
<p>Imagine a website known as the best destination for up to the second sports information for the newest and most popular sports of all time: Multiball. It's a mixture of all the most popular sports including football (soccer), baseball, basketball, rugby, tennis, cricket and motor sports. This new game is fast paced and jam packed with statistics which change every second. Today there is a really big game on between Great Britain and USA. The world wants to watch this game but it's during the day for many people who will be at work in front of their computers so they'll be logging on to this well known website to keep up to date with the scores. The game is tied in the 4th quarter with only 1 minute remaining and millions of users from around the world starting hitting the F5 key and clicking the "Refresh" button in their web browser to refreshing the website and check for the latest score. The servers hosting the website can't handle the load and crash.</p>

<p>
<img src="/images/kwwika/1_request.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>

<p>Some websites try to get around this scenario by adding some script to their score web page which polls the server for an update at a set interval. The problem with this is that the web server still has to deal with, in effect, a refresh although the data returned to the request can be much smaller.<br />

<p><img src="/images/kwwika/2_polling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>The most obvious use of a real-time push system is that as soon as a server (or score system) receives new information it can push it to any application instance that is interested in that information. In the above Multibal' website example the application instance is each web browser session logged on to the website. If the sports website were using a real-time push system this would mean that they could instantly push any changes in the score to each web browser session which would mean that each website user wouldn't need to refresh their page (reloading the whole page) to check if the score had changed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kwwika/3_push.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a&gt;</p>

This alone would take a massive load off of the sports website infrastructure, but it's possible to take things even further.</p>

<p>Even in the real-time push scenario the sports website would need to build and maintain the real-time push infrastructure and push an update to each of the millions of website users. From the information above you'll know that real-time push services can help them out with the infrastructure. The new, and game changing feature that Kwwika offers is that when Rooney Giggs McFadden makes that game winning manoeuvre-score for Great Britain the sports website would only need to publish the score update once into the Kwwika service (<strong>real-time push-once</strong>). Kwwika would then instantly distribute that update to the millions of website users. This means the website only ever needs to deal with single page loads from its users and <strong>push</strong> out each score change or game statistic <strong>once</strong>, Kwwika does the rest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kwwika/4_push-once.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a&gt;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Selling your used car</strong><br />
We own a 53 Reg Peugeot 206 and are thinking of an upgrade. I'm not really into cars - I just use them to get from A to B. I'm not really all that fond of the idea of selling privately although I know that it's probably the best way of getting the most for your used car. Having a look at car price guides such as <a href="http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/prices/">Parkers</a> or <a href="http://www.whatcar.com/valuations">WhatCar</a> confirms this although a garage will tell you that these guides mean nothing (unfortunately they do mean something as they set a sellers expectation). The values for "Private in good condition" varied by a few hundred pounds but I set my expectations at around £2,000. So, I decided to try out WeBuyAnyCar.com to see what they would offer me.<br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/RhiVaoIGAu9XsGTjI1vyNclCVqLoIMeoI1nrDoaYtN9wjopagrbhsfF1CWsN/WeBuyAnyCar-com_1-195k.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/zl3Pb2AgattEBdw8EjQCszIFXfji2HvEFjh5mvMxRAL2FgSBL4Cnj49zWaVi/WeBuyAnyCar-com_1-195k.png.scaled.500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="309" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/RhiVaoIGAu9XsGTjI1vyNclCVqLoIMeoI1nrDoaYtN9wjopagrbhsfF1CWsN/WeBuyAnyCar-com_1-195k.png"></a>I filled in the online form and instantly got a valuation of £1,195. Due to the difference between my expectation and the offer price being £800 I decided to not proceed with the sale through WeBuyAnyCar.com.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-1326"></a></p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I received a few more emails from WeBuyAnyCar.com about the valuation. I ignored them all <strong>knowing </strong>the price they were offering me was unfair. I know they need to make a profit but I'm afraid roughly a 40% profit is extracting the urine.</p>
<p>Last week I went into the local Honda garage, <a href="http://www.westendgarage.net/">West End Garage</a>, who provided truly excellent customer service. They checked over the car, did some research and gave me part-exchange quote of £1,700. This is still £300 off what I was hoping for but it's within the realms of acceptability. This was still £500 better than WeBuyAnyCar.com.</p>
<p><strong>Shock and Scare Tactics</strong><br />
Yesterday I got a call from my Dad about an article he'd read an some newspaper (I think <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/banking/7938184/Eastern-European-cyber-criminals-draining-British-bank-accounts.html">this</a> may be the article - I've not read it). The article was about a computer virus that automatically transferred funds out of your bank account and it recommended that you phoned up all your banks and disabled any bank transfers. The article sounded like it had quite a few quotes from an Internet security firm who, to me, were really playing this up and using it as a big marketing opportunity. These shock and scare tactics really, <strong>really</strong>, annoy me. I told my Dad that he should make sure his anti-virus was up to date, check his firewall was on and told him that he also had a hardware firewall in his router so he should be okay as long as he didn't do anything silly like run random downloaded or email attachment files. Common sense, not shock and scare!</p>
<p>This morning I got an email from WeBuyAnyCar.com:<br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/5O2NUy2UbyM2y38RXLuKsz1Tuxsm0DfHZKM3fa1tqjrlncXKzkeMszeKBSAa/WeBuyAnyCar-com_1-355k.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/leggetter/eJHTzgDOZOJyZHLxls4Q6x00WNHGe7H9Ymep34PVGMNXSGlOLfIAoFpaxr1t/WeBuyAnyCar-com_1-355k.png.scaled.500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="570" /></a></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><p>As a previous customer of webuyanycar.com , we are please to inform you that your car price has increased! We constantly review our prices to ensure that our customers receive the best possible valuation for their car in line with market prices.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><p>Your car has already been re-valued using the details you initially supplied and we're delighted to issue an increased valuation of £1,355 assuming the condition of your car is unchanged and still available for sale.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><p>Due to fluctuating market conditions, we can only hold your new valuation for seven days. So, if you're still in the market to sell your car please book your appointment online and sell your car the easy way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shock and scare! Not in exactly the same way as the Internet security firm but pretty damn close in my eyes. I'm particularly annoyed by this sentence:</p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><p>This September sees the launch of the new '60' plate, and used car values are typically at a high before the release of any new plate, however prices will also plummet almost immediately afterwards</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly nobody wants the value of anything they own to <strong>plummet</strong>! They are offering an instant jump in your car value of £160, for <strong>seven days only</strong> and then the potential of losing even more money on your car. In some circumstances this increase of £160 would be enough to potentially make somebody make an impulse decision about selling the car but when added to the possibility of the value plummeting the chances increase further.</p>
<p><strong>Negative Brand Equity</strong><br />
I share the same opinion as Gary Vaynerchuk in that the Internet is leading to <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/247583674/small-town-rules">small town rules</a> on a global scale. This means that customer service and <strong>honesty</strong> matter. If you deliver exceptional customer service, and to do that you <strong>must</strong> be honest, then you will ultimately be rewarded. Your brand will become recognised, valued and trusted.<br />
With the sorts of tactics that WeBuyAnyCar.com are applying it won't be long until their brand is dirt. It already is to me.</p>

	Over the past few weeks we've been dabbling with first creating a <a href="http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub_implementation">PUbSubHubbub Subscriber</a> and then building <a href="http://superfeedr.kwwika.com">a cool real-time demo</a> which integrates the real-time feed goodness from <a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr</a>&nbsp;with the real-time client push wickedness of <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a>.</p>
<p />

<p>The demo itself took a couple of days to build and allows a user to subscriber to any RSS feed or track any keyword using Superfeedr. When Superfeedr receives a real-time update it’ll push that update to a web server which will then instantly push that update through Kwwika and into the demo web application.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>RSS source → pubsubhubbub → Superfeedr → pubsubhubbub → webserver → Kwwika → Web client&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>The application shows RSS and track updates in real-time in a web client which you could think of it like a real-time push RSS reader. We’re hosting the application and are restricting the demo to 10 subscriptions unless you have logged in to use your own dedicated demo. If you want your own dedicated demo then you’ll first need a Superfeedr account and then <a href="http://kwwika.com/Contact">get in touch with us at Kwwika</a> and we’ll set up the demo account for you on our servers. Once that’s done you’ll be able to log into the demo using your Superfeedr credentials. More information on <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/demos/kwwika-superfeedr-demo#TOC-How-to-get-your-own-dedicated-demo">setting up a dedicated demo can be found on the Kwwika Wiki</a>.<br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/Bu0c9DiJyL1WFj7S9K3156z2e3zD7eJHdtZbTnQ5gbGq9mPaFs684FQmsLwD/Kwwika-SuperfeedrDemoScreen.png.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/2B62K6qLiwFCNf2zorcH1B3C1XQ3HEaJYS6owrVCrz1522WafYhnZLZtrxfL/Kwwika-SuperfeedrDemoScreen.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="299" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>If you are a developer you'll be pleased to know that the the <a href="http://github.com/kwwika/ASP.NET-MVC-PubSubHubbub-Subscriber/tree/Kwwika-Superfeedr-Demo">source code for this application is available on GitHub</a>. The code is an <a href="http://asp.net">ASP.NET</a> MVC solution although you could easily take the principles and create the demo in almost any other language. Just <a href="http://kwwika.com/Contact">get in touch</a> if you are interested.<br />
It's also important to remember that this is a pretty simple demo and that this technology has a lot of potential. Even this demo can be improved in terms of usability, feed parsing to ensure all the information a user could need is pushed through, pulling in older feed items from some of the subscriptions, pausing updates, some general UI updates (which are in the pipeline) and so much more. Why not take the code and see what you can do with this? We'd be happy to help!</p>
<p />

<p>Here’s a little walk through of the demo:<br /></p>
<object height="300" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rjb5lNcAFWQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;hd=1" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />&lt;/param&gt;<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rjb5lNcAFWQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;hd=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="300" width="500" />&lt;/embed&gt;</object>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>So, why not try out the <a href="http://superfeedr.kwwika.com">Kwwika-Superfeedr demo</a> and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm building an ASP.NET MVC2 web application and I was trying to access ViewData in my Site.Master page and I kept getting "master does not have a definition for ViewData".</p>
<p>[code lang="xml"]&lt;%= ViewData[&quot;topic&quot;] %&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>The simple answer was that my Master Page was not an ASP.NET MVC2 master page. Somehow I had a standard master page.</p>
<p>So, all I did was swap the existing page declaration</p>
<p>[code lang="xml"]&lt;%@ Master Language=&quot;C#&quot; AutoEventWireup=&quot;true&quot; CodeBehind=&quot;Site.Master.cs&quot; Inherits=&quot;HubSubscriber.Views.Shared.Site&quot; %&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>With an ASP.NET MVC2 declaration:</p>
<p>[code lang="xml"]&lt;%@ Master Language=&quot;C#&quot; Inherits=&quot;System.Web.Mvc.ViewMasterPage&quot; %&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>And bingo! ViewData was now accessible from my master page.</p>
<p>This post on <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/passing-data-to-view-master-pages-cs">Passing Data to View Master Pages</a> may also be useful.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[The death of "F5" Ah, I get it!]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/the-death-of-f5-ah-i-get-it</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/the-death-of-f5-ah-i-get-it</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently did an interview about Kwwika with <a href="http://www.jane-adams.com/">Jane Adams</a> for <a href="http://www.scotif.com/">Innovation Focus Scotland</a>. We chatted about what Kwwika offered, what our costing model is (or will be), what competition we have and how we will differ from that competition. I also responded to a questionnaire that Jane sent me which asked questions about innovation in Scotland and what the challenges that being based in Scotland were.</p>
<p>The following day I was looking through our website stats and noticed a few hits from an article on the Innovation Focus Scotland site with the title "<a href="http://www.scotif.com/the-death-of-f5/">The death of F5</a>". It honestly took me about 10 seconds of repeating to myself "the death of F5", "the death of F5", "the death of F5" and then I twigged. When discussing Kwwika to Jane I explained real-time push using a common scenario:</p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><p>When you go to a website with "live" information, such as a sports scores or frequently updating news site, and you want to check to see if things have updated you quite frequently refresh the page every so often, using the "F5" key, to see if any new information is available. If that website used Kwwika the website user wouldn't need to refresh the page. That page will always be up to date, to around 500 millisecond, with any new information that has been pushed through Kwwika and into the web page.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I'm so engrossed in the technology that even though you use this scenario all the time, to highlight a simple and fundamental benefit to the user of real-time push, you forget just how beneficial it is to the user experience. It's a pretty simple concept and it really will lead to "the death of F5" since there will be no need for a user of a standard website to refresh the page once real-time push is introduced to it. F5 will be left to be used by developers who want to check the impact of their code change on their web page or application. Will the refresh button disappear as one of the main buttons in a web browser?</p>
<p>A big thanks to Jane for the article and for reminding me about a fundamental benefit of Kwwika and real-time push.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Basic Authentication against the Superfeedr HTTP PubSubHubbub API using a .NET HttpWebRequest]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/basic-authentication-against-the-superfeedr-h</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/basic-authentication-against-the-superfeedr-h</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It would appear that setting the Credentials property of a HttpWebRequest still leads to authentication failure against the <a href="http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub">Superfeedr HTTP PubSubHubbub API</a>. This might be because the way the HttpWebRequest works is that it first waits to be challenged for credentials via a 401 (not authorized) and then replies with the authentication (<a href="http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/243915.aspx">more info include PreAuthenticate here</a>).</p>
<p>So, this doesn't work:<br />
[code lang="csharp"]<br />
string username = &quot;username&quot;;<br />
string password = &quot;password&quot;;<br />
HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(&quot;url-here&quot;);<br />
request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password);<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>To work around this you need to force the authentication to be sent. I found the details of how to do this in a blog post by Ian Dykes here:</p>
<p><a href="http://devproj20.blogspot.com/2008/02/assigning-basic-authorization-http.html">http://devproj20.blogspot.com/2008/02/assigning-basic-authorization-http.html</a></p>
<p>But for fullness here's the code:</p>
<p>[code lang="csharp"]<br />
string username = &quot;username&quot;;<br />
string password = &quot;password&quot;;<br />
byte[] authBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(username + &quot;:&quot; + password.ToCharArray());<br />
request.Headers[&quot;Authorization&quot;] = &quot;Basic &quot; + Convert.ToBase64String(authBytes);<br />
[/code]</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Want to try out the Kwwika API but don't want to register?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/want-to-try-out-the-kwwika-api-but-dont-want</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/want-to-try-out-the-kwwika-api-but-dont-want</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We're try to get more and more people using Kwwika and we feel that registering is maybe a barrier to entry. So, we've decided to give everybody access to our service. The only caveat is that we've just enabled access from your local development machine, assuming you can run a local application from <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>.</p>
<p />

<p>So, if you want to try out the Kwwika JavaScript API but don’t want to <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">register</a> (yet), then go ahead. There’s a topic that you can subscribe and publish to named /KWWIKA/SANDBOX.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>You can even start building a <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition">Kwwika World Cup 2010 Real-Time Push Web App</a> because we’ve give <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> access to <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition#TOC-What-data-must-be-used-in-the-web-a">the data you need to use to enter the competition</a>:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<ul>
<li>
/OPTA/WC2010/TEAMLIVE</li>
<li>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/SEARCHES/WC2010/*</li>
</ul>
<p />

<p>If you need help getting started you can of course <a href="http://kwwika.com/Contact">get in touch</a> or start by going through our <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/the-real-time-web-workshop">Real-Time Web Workshop</a>. This workshop contains a presentation, a set of exercises and all the files (<a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/the-real-time-web-workshop">download</a>) that you need to go through the exercises. This even in includes and executable webserver to run on windows, a webserver app to run on Mac and a python webserver to run on Linux (or any other python enabled machine).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>So, why not start developing using Kwwika now. And if you like it, or are just damn good at developing real-time push apps, why not <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">register</a> and <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition">enter our World Cup 2010 competition</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/jquery-real-time-push-kwwika-plugin-v01-relea</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> Unfortunately Kwwika is no more. But I've created a similar plugin for <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> who I now work for. You can get the <a href="https://github.com/leggetter/jquery.realtime">realtime jQuery plugin here</a>.</p>
<hr />

<p>Kwwika already makes it really easy to add real-time push functionality to any web page or website but we've gone a little bit further to try to make it <strong>even easier</strong> by writing a small but powerful jQuery plugin.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/plugins/jquery-real-time-push-kwwika-plugin">jQuery Real-Time Push Kwwika Plugin</a> allows you to define elements within a web page that you want to be updated with real-time data as soon as it's available. Anybody that has used a jQuery plugin should find our jQuery plugin really simple to use.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-865"></a><br />
Here's how to use it.</p>
<h3 id="register-for-the-kwwika-beta"><a href="#register-for-the-kwwika-beta">Register for the Kwwika Beta</a></h3>
<p>In order to use Kwwika you must first <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">register</a> so we can set up permissions within the Kwwika system to allow your website/domain to receive real-time push data from Kwwika.</p>
<p>So, register for the <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">Kwwika Beta programme</a> now.</p>
<h3 id="include-script-tags"><a href="#include-script-tags">Include script tags</a></h3>
<p>You need to include the core jQuery library, the Kwwika JavaScript API and the jQuery Real-Time Push Kwwika Plugin files in your web page:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="html"]<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://api.kwwika.com/latest/&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://api.kwwika.com/latest/plugins/jQuery/jquery.kwwika/jquery.kwwika.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<h3 id="define-html"><a href="#define-html">Define HTML</a></h3>
<p>You define the topic to be requested from Kwwika by adding an attribute to an HTML element. The default attribute to identify the topic to request is <strong>data-topic</strong>. You identify the value to be placed within the element by adding a <strong>data-field</strong> attribute to the same element. In the example below if an update occurs on the /KWWIKA/TWITTER/SEARCHES/KWWIKA topic with a value for the ScreenName field it will be inserted as the html contents of the first &lt;div&gt; element.</p>
<p>We've decided to use attributes with a prefix of "data-" as the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#custom-data-attribute">present HTML 5 draft suggests custom attributes should use this prefix</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><p><a style="background-color: #ffffaa;" title="custom data attribute" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#custom-data-attribute"><span style="color: #444444;">Custom data attributes</span></a> are intended to store custom data private to the page or application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or elements.</p></blockquote>
<p>[sourcecode language="html"]<br />
&lt;html&gt;<br />
    &lt;body&gt;<br />
        &lt;div data-topic=&quot;/KWWIKA/TWITTER/SEARCHES/KWWIKA&quot;<br />
     data-field=&quot;ScreenName&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
        &lt;div data-topic=&quot;/KWWIKA/TWITTER/SEARCHES/KWWIKA&quot;<br />
     data-field=&quot;Text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
    &lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<h3 id="call-the-jquery-plugin"><a href="#call-the-jquery-plugin">Call the jQuery plugin</a></h3>
<p>You call the jQuery Real-Time Push Kwwika Plugin in the same way you call any other jQuery plugin, by supplying a selector to the jQuery method ($) and calling the kwwika() function.</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="html"]<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />
    $(function ()<br />
    {<br />
        $(&quot;div&quot;).kwwika();<br />
    });<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<h3 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h3>
<p>You can find three examples of how to use the jQuery Real-Time Push Kwwika Plugin from the links below:</p>
<p>The <a style="color: #0033cc; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://api.kwwika.com/latest/plugins/jQuery/jquery.kwwika/examples/">jQuery Real-Time Push Kwwika Plugin examples</a> can be found on the API site:<br />

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/the-real-time-web-world-cup-experience</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
	A number big players have come up with pages or applications in an attempt to draw World Cup fans into either combining using a laptop whilst watching the live games on television or using the application as their main view into the World Cup. The problem is that nobody has got it quite right. With a live event the data that you see in your World Cup web application needs to be correct with up to the second information or it loses its value. None of the big players have managed this. The data also needs to be relevant and of good quality. The Twitter application fails in this respect.
<p />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-857"></a><br />
The BBC have adapted their standard look and feel to incorporate a video or audio component for their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/">BBC World Cup 2010 presence</a>. They also got a &quot;live&quot; commentary section, some team information and match stats. The commentary updates every 30 seconds. Updating every 30 seconds just isn&#39;t good enough. I want to see comments appear about the event that is happening <b>now</b>, not 2 minutes ago!
<p /><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/A2YXfKVY0hNCbwXICxIF4H2JdjZsoefeRex6Dg9tRmUN7hBnIwM2JGntrJ21/bbc.png.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/VCQmscOgrcBu0fMBvkmeyCDc3UPfq19J6UQDI0b0ieohYhgssoJ23SVrLeXn/bbc.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="361" /></a></p>
<p />

<p>The <a href="http://live.itv.com/">ITV Live application</a> has a lot going on. They've thrown in textual updates, facts, video replays, statistics and polls. I like the facts and the replays but the main failing on ITV Live is that you just don't feel that you want or need to stay on the website. It's not adding a lot of value to the World Cup experience. More needs to go into the "Get Involved" section as you can see from the screenshot below.</p>
<p />

<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/NPhoSw27Kcd6Pwo3rYNbLd8q9CO20w7Jm4IPSarxMhtlMcbesO5fFDTt0hNp/itv.png.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/Mtk9Y7ThMptoazAjZr3ZjCHRTyZayPRJvP7NX8CBac3LNe4dR8qoHP07r3uR/itv.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>I quite like the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/index.html">Fifa application</a> although it doesn't add much to the experience if you are also viewing the games live on television until you scroll down the page and see the "Have your say", "Fantasy", "Head-to-Head" stats and live groups standings section.</p>
<p />

<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/N6ikeZcnmHsdyW7d9rRnSpXSYMBs50qv4kmiREUNnaI03rrrOndEX4ZCzq5B/fifa.png.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/mMWse7qKcTAzPhM2Gvg8kH6jg45hqH0wK51clHDx40NEMXiA6C4ciCogTyQX/fifa.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="330" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>I'm really disappointing with the <a href="http://twitter.com/worldcup/worldcup">Twitter World Cup 2010 application</a>. They've probably got more data than anybody else but the problem is they're not doing enough analysis on it, or giving the user the opportunity of doing some filtering. The data isn't real-time and you would have thought that they would be able to afford to put some effort into the application. We've thrown together a <a href="http://kwwika.com/Standalone/Demos/WorldCup2010/">real-time application for the World Cup</a> in a couple of hours to show off all the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23worldcup">#worldcup tweets</a> in real-time. At least our application has a bit of impact.</p>
<p />

<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/AW0erM6Oazay347ou6hz1Wl4WJ8oeyw1s3h78imWQpWOwC65Dy24VW9isIk2/twitter.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/vp6HvsbY7uGhBBfdFh4IYvHvCmxjyKu8O8kk1cMrm5RnCO8jdPr51uZ2oPJY/twitter.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="347" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Now, to get to the point. All these big players have come up with an application for the World Cup but we're sure that developers out there could come up with something better. If you feel you could develop a <b>better real-time World Cup 2010 application</b> then why not <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition">enter our Kwwika World Cup 2010 Real-Time Push Web App competition</a>? We will make all #worldcup tweets available to you and will also be adding some world class World Cup statistics data for you to use within you application. The developer who builds the best application will win an Apple iPad.</p>
<p />

<p>Go on, <a href="http://wiki.kwwika.com/competitions/world-cup-2010-real-time-push-web-app-competition">enter our competition</a> and show BBC, ITV, Fifa and Twitter what a quality World Cup application should look like.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/chromesafari-webkit-real-time-push-always-loa</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With real-time push becoming mainstream more and more developers are going to start adding real-time push to their website. One minor user experience hurdle still to be fully solved for webkit based browsers is the "always loading indicator" which can appear if a streaming connection has been established to a push server or service. This indicator appears due to the streaming connection that has been established between JavaScript in the web browser, using an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest">XMLHttpRequest object</a>, where you are effectively continually loading, or waiting, for content from the push server.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-822"></a><br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/vXym0AE8k4GSV4JAp9uURQHFV4Bc3nClkXAjl2wLkCHyoGLkoFYJstYLEAK5/always_loading_chrome.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/W9nJXCPgWod1EGqOivbOZjkR1fAind9PrjhujxYFLgjD06rw27y5Wk59EewZ/always_loading_chrome.png.scaled.500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></a><br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/P3BUZD3J3OH5XVmNTJGETKEax0EEpHamdXsYdD7dzPW0V2N7aFq442GHn4gf/always_loading_safari.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/7GT2jM1keczbNr5zUqjDSJP1e0bJFzeFF0tB7CSowN7ubnka6EKo1ziDLsay/always_loading_safari.png.scaled.500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/chromesafari-webkit-real-time-push-always-loa">See and download the full gallery on posterous</a></p>
<p>It makes sense that webkit-based browsers do something to detect if a page has loaded and then stop displaying the loading indicator. However, it's still a bit unclear what determines if the loading indicator will be shown when a streaming connection is established from JavaScript. Following a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=chrome+loading+indicator+comet&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=">bit of googling</a> and some tinkering it would appear that you can stop the loading indicator if you establish your streaming connection after all other page content has loaded. Oh, it's easy then? Nope! Determining when all page content has loaded doesn't appear to be as simple as you would think.</p>
<p>To save some time I tried establishing my streaming connection to Kwwika at different points in the page loading process using the jQuery library:</p>
<ol>
<li>DomContentReady via the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/ready/">.ready() jQuery function</a> (also see <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3">$(calback)</a>)</li>
<li>window.onload via the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load-event/">.load() jQuery function</a></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Google Chrome</span><br />
When connecting within the .ready() callback the loading indicator would always appear.</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]<br />
$(document).ready(function()<br />
{<br />
    var oConn = kwwika.Service.connect();<br />
});<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>However, if you use the .load() callback 99% of the time the loading indicator would disappear after the page was loaded and then the real-time push connection would be established.</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]<br />
$(window).load(function()<br />
{<br />
    var oConn = kwwika.Service.connect();<br />
});<br />
[/code]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Safari</span><br />
In Safari the results when using the .ready() callback were exactly the same.</p>
<p>For the .load callback I had to introduce an additional wait using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout">window.setTimeout</a> in order to lose the loading indicator.<br />
<span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">$(window).load(setTimeout(function()</span><br />
<span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">{</span><br />
<span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;"> var oConn = kwwika.Service.connect();</span><br />
<span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">}, 10000));</span></p>
<p>If the .load() solution worked for both webkit-based browsers then I'd be happy to say that this problem has been resolved. However, having to add a random timeout to lose the loading indicator in Safari means that, for now, I think this is going to be a continuing annoyance for developers and will also impact the real-time push web application user experience by suggesting to users that the web application has not fully loaded.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_will_push_real-time_feeds_to_browser.php">revealed</a> that Google are going to release a version of their API that supports Real-Time news push. Real-time push technology has been around for ages and there are a <a href="http://cometdaily.com/maturity.html">number of technologies</a> that allow you to host your own real-time push server. However, more recently hosted solutions have come about. Kwwika is one of these solutions.</p>
<p />

<p>However, why restrict yourself to just news updates when there are services such a <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika</a> that allow you to add real-time push containing any data to your website!</p>
<p />

<p>If you have data that you want to <strong>push your data in real-time</strong> then you can use Kwwika to easily and instantly distribute your data to thousands of users. This can be great for showing the quality of your data and proving you use the most up to date technologies to give your data consumers a massive advantage. If you want to<strong> add real-time data to your website</strong> then you can easily subscribe to data and have it update instantly in your website.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Why not <a href="http://kwwika.com/Contact">get in touch with Kwwika</a> or <a href="http://kwwika.com/#getbeta">sign up for the beta programme</a> and see how you can either real-time push your data or add real-time push to your website, Rich Internet Application (RIA) or desktop application.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>I'm doing a real-time web workshop on May 16 for the SPA 2010 Conference and I'd like to do a trial run with a group of around eight people to get feedback and refine it some more. Details about the workshop can be found here:<br />
<a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2010/sessions/session303.html"> http://www.spaconference.org/spa2010/sessions/session303.html</a></p>
<p>In the workshop we'll discuss the real-time web and the enabling technologies, highlight the comet/server push technologies that are presently available, and use the <a href="http://kwwika.com">Kwwika service</a> to show how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add real-time data to any web page</li>
<li>Create a <em>better</em> real-time search results page</li>
<li>Add real-time publishing from a web page</li>
<li>Create a real-time collaboration and communication example</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is sufficient interest I'll try and sort out a venue next week. The workshop will probably take around 3.5 hours so I'll need to sort out times once I get an idea of interest. I'll try to keep the presentation side of things to a minimum and concerntrate on discussion and development exercises. For this we'll need internet access and a computer for development. It may also be a good idea to pair during the exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Where?</strong></p>
<p>Edinburgh or Dundee during the week beginning Monday 10 May 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, please give me a shout if you are interested. Or if you would be interested but don't have that much time to spare maybe we can do a shortened version.</strong></p>

      <title><![CDATA[#LeadersDebate demo retrospective]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/leadersdebate-demo-retrospective</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/http:/blog.kwwika.com/leadersdebate-demo-retrospective</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Following on from the <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/how-did-we-build-that-leadersdebate-demo">first #LeadersDebate demo blog post</a> we thought it would be good to look back on how we built the demo, how it performed on the two debate evenings and determine what worked and what did not.</p>
<p>We'd hoped to be able to do more to improve the performance of <a href="http://kwwika.com/Demos/TwitterRealTimeVisualisation/LeadersDebate">the #LeadersDebate demo</a> between the second and final debate but time constraints mean we only just managed to make one improvement. This improvement was to remove the retweets (RT) from the demo. This meant that the tweet mention count better reflected unique tweets and the amount of data being pushed through the Kwwika service, and more importantly, to each web browser viewing the demo.<br />
 <br />
The latter is where the demo really fell down on each of the debate evenings. During the one and a half hour event last night around 120,000 tweets were made containing the tag #LeadersDebate. This means that on average there were over 1,300 tweets per minute and over 20 tweets per second.<br />
 <a id="more"></a><a id="more-825"></a><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">How much data?</span></p>
<p />

<p>The amount of data that we are talking about probably isn’t too much data for a web page to handle until you drill into the contents of the data and look at what is being done on the web page itself.<br />
 <br />
Only a small amount of the tweet data being sent to the browser was actually being displayed. Here’s a sample message:<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/RH8qHbax35229AVtku7ukOPW6acn9TQOH0D0L0s7NnCd2TMdTkbQTiCMUAbO/Firebug_mUpdate.png.scaled.1000.jpg"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/RN5jpMsKedxkIoCLF7ND7V1FIspvy55jUBiAZDUi4SmFJCRJuzn2qLu2um3V/Firebug_mUpdate.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="179" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p> <br />
In the case of the #LeadersDebate demo we only really needed ScreenName, Text, UserProfileImageUrl, TotalTweets and sometimes the reply based fields. If we had only sent through the data we actually needed this would have made a small, but useful, dent in the amount of data the web browser would need to process.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large;">What did we do with the data?</span></p>
<p />

<p><strong>Calculations</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Once we had received the data we did a few calculations. We worked out the total number of tweets received for all the leaders together. So, TotalTweets could be 136,690,  BrownTweets 31,020, CameronTweets 38,313 and CleggTweets 28,704. So, the total leader tweets would be 98,037 (31,020 + 38,313 + 28,704).<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/ker3ziIybYyH4lU5YYx0oFK3HnOz8yW3ZKH8EAyDwr6DDObVKmcX5i4Nk2Ax/LeadersDebateTotals.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/nTliIiJ1cUarDI7jxWKoW7WNkpF5AIOauajkkMxjhs55pHScg1IGPitgSJIq/LeadersDebateTotals.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="103" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p> <br />
On top of this we also converted these figures into percentages. Brown on 32% (31,020 / 98,037), Cameron on 39% (38,313 / 98,037) and Clegg on (28,704 / 98,037).<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/B7qwYN3kJPu5OJdklIB6AdDWoAgXUlMTe5VO8JMBwjEGMOEJld7hL9lR50zY/leadersPercentage.png"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/kwwika/yQBiCAin9W96oGefzlnZizoNKuEHS3Ih3t9zCmfSy4gZVKa3I5a1yjg1cA3Y/leadersPercentage.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>Although these are simple and small calculations they were performed each time there was a tweet update; 20 times a second.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Filtering</strong><br />
 <br />
Since we were receiving all #LeadersDebate updates but we wanted to make sure that each tweet was analysed to ensure that it went into the appropriate leaders' column. So, as each tweet came in we would perform a textual match on the tweet message (mUpdate.Text). This was done once per column for each tweet and there were also multiple filters to check against e.g. for David Cameron we filtered on David, Cameron, DC, Dave, Tories, Tory, Conservatives and a few others.<br />
 <br />
We also added the ability to live filter the far left column. We did this using some <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">jQuery selectors</a> and if you'd have tried this as the debate was happening it is more than likely that your browser crashed.<br />
 <br />
The main thing to learn here is it's still much better to do intensive work such as this in the Kwwika.NET application that is consuming all the data in real-time from the Twitter Streaming API. We were publishing all #leaderdebate tweets on the /KWWIKA/TWITTER/HASHTAGS/LEADERSDEBATE topic when instead we should have published things on different topics to allow the web browser client to concentrate on just displaying the data. Maybe having a few topics like this would have worked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet Counts and statistics: <em>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/HASHTAGS/LEADERSDEBATE/COUNTS</em> </li>
<li>Brown Tweets: <em>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/HASHTAGS/LEADERSDEBATE/BROWN</em> </li>
<li>Cameron Tweets: <em>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/HASHTAGS/LEADERSDEBATE/CAMERON</em> </li>
<li>Clegg Tweets: <em>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/HASHTAGS/LEADERSDEBATE/CLEGG</em> </li>
<li>Tweets that didn't mention any leader but still contained #LeadersDebate: <em>/KWWIKA/TWITTER/HASHTAGS/LEADERSDEBATE/OTHER</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Using this all count and percentage calculations could have been done within the Kwwika.NET application, which was running on a web server, and pushed to the /<em>COUNTS </em>topic, all tweets about specific or multiple leaders could have gone to the appropriate leader topic, /<em>BROWN</em>, /<em>CAMERON</em>, /<em>CLEGG</em> and all others to /<em>OTHER</em>. The Brown column would display all /BROWN tweets, the Cameron column all /CAMERON tweets, the Clegg column all /<em>CLEGG </em>tweets and the all column would combine /<em>OTHER</em>, /<em>BROWN</em>, /<em>CAMERON</em> and /<em>CLEGG</em>.<br />
 <br />
It's potentially a bit more complex this way, since the Kwwika.NET API application has to analyse tweets and publish them to different topics, but it certainly take all strain off of the client.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large;">How was the data displayed?</span></p>
<p />

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.kwwika.com/how-did-we-build-that-leadersdebate-demo">first #LeadersDebate blog post</a> we decided upon four columns. One for each leader and one to display all the tweets. The columns were formed from a Kwwika Twitter Widget that we’ve built and we enhanced it to allow us to make it a bit more configurable. You can see the widget standalone on the <a href="http://kwwika.com/About">About Kwwika</a> page. We also decided to use two <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery.html">Google interactive charts</a> to provide a visual representation of the data as it arrived in real-time.<br />
 <br />
One of the enhancements we added to the Kwwika Twitter widget was to add some <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/">jQuery effects</a> to allow the tweets to <a href="http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/">slide down</a> into view. At low update rates this is a really nice effect. At higher update rates your browser is unlikely to cope.<br />
 <br />
The charting components are also a really nice effect at lower update rates but as soon as the update rates increase they don’t really cope.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Bug!</span>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p />

<p>Yep, we admit it. There was a bug in our code. If you viewed the demo and things appeared to be working fine for you but then you stopped getting updates you’ve probably been bitten. We’ll fix this in our core library very soon.<br />
 &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">What did we prove?</span><br />
 <br />
We've proven that our Kwwika technology is clearly the bees knee's. We had absolutely no problems within the Kwwika service or within our Kwwika.NET application. We also think that the JavaScript Kwwika API held our well with the exception of the bug we've found.<br />
 <br />
The main thing for us is that it was very clear during the 20+ tweets per second period that there was no way that any human being could actually read the tweets. The statistics were very interesting so maybe the demo should have concerntrated on that rather than the individual tweets. If we'd have done this and done the tweet analysis in the Kwwika.NET application running on a server then the web browser would have had absolutely no problem at all dealing with the update rate.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Browsers</span><br />
 <br />
It's potentially a little unfair to suggest a best browser since our bug mean using some other browsers was pretty tricky. However, for us, Chrome seemed to stand up to the update rate and seemed to work around the bug far better than Firefox or Internet Explorer.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Conclusion</span><br />
 <br />
By considering the following we would certainly be able to improve the #LeadersDebate performance and user experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a little calculating and analysis in the client as possible when you are dealing with high volume data.</li>
<li>Organise the data so that the client doesn't have to.</li>
<li>Only send that data that is needed to the web browser. Don't send unused fields.</li>
<li>Consider the update rate. If the target consumer is a human being will they be able to read the data?</li>
<li>At high data rates visual effects and charting components don't seem to work in a web browser. For charting consider pulsing the data or only making an update at set intervals.</li>
<li>We could certainly dig even deeper into the causes of the browser slow down by using tools to analyse bottle necks and potential areas for memory leaks within the browser.</li>
</ol>
<p> <br />
<span style="font-size: large;">We'll give you the code</span></p>
<p />

<p>
We built this as a demo. It's not a product. So, if you would like to build something similar and want a starting point we are happy to have a chat and give you the code. So, <a href="http://kwwika.com/Contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/04/09/a-real-time-web-business-by-product-example.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ian Sanders recently posted a great thought provoking <a href="http://scrambledup.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-are-your-business-by-products.html">blog article about business by-products</a>. I won't go into detail, Ian's post does that, but it's basically about finding value in things that aren't your key business focus but what you just have to do, day to day, in order to run your business or do your job.</p>
<p>I've just this minute finished a Skype chat with a work colleague. As I was having the chat I realised that the conversation we were having had real value. It was a really good question to be asking and that if I didn't record this conversation now that I'd probably lose it and the potential value would be lost.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-790"></a></p>
<p>So, here's the conversation. I've posted it in its raw format but I'll write a bit of JavaScript to spruce up the look over the next hour.</p>
<blockquote><p>[12:13:30] Adam DeWeb: can I ask you a question about the REAL TIME WEB?<br />
[12:13:59] Phil Leggetter: Oh yes. I'm very knowledgeable in that area you know :O)<br />
[12:14:09] Adam DeWeb: yes, I found you by googling<br />
[12:14:28] Phil Leggetter: I'm sure you didn't really. If you did I'd be very excited.<br />
[12:14:36] Adam DeWeb: what I don't understand is, I get how everything from one of our real-time APIs to all other subscribed real-time APIs is true real time<br />
[12:14:58] Adam DeWeb: but I don't see how you get that initial hop from the raw datasource to the real-time API to be push, and if you can't do that then it's not real time<br />
[12:15:16] Adam DeWeb: e.g if the data comes from a database and your kwwika client queries the database every 5 seconds then you're polling, not push<br />
[12:15:32] Phil Leggetter: you can have database triggers<br />
[12:15:50] Phil Leggetter: they fire whenever a new row is inserted or an update occurs<br />
[12:16:10] Phil Leggetter: or a web developer may choose to send the update out as they are about to, or have just updated the database<br />
[12:16:41] Adam DeWeb: ok<br />
[12:16:56] Adam DeWeb: do you think it's always going to possible to get that first hop to be push though? not just databases but what about twitter etc<br />
[12:17:07] Adam DeWeb: I know twitter has a push feed now<br />
[12:17:16] Adam DeWeb: hmm, I've run out of examples where it wouldn't work<br />
[12:17:45] Phil Leggetter: I think it's a good example<br />
[12:17:59] Phil Leggetter: these sorts of things should probably be in an FAQ<br />
[12:18:35] Adam DeWeb: I guess the point is that for it to be true real time it has to be push all the way through the chain<br />
[12:18:50] Adam DeWeb: if people didn't get that and they were doing polling at the back end then they'd lose the advantage<br />
[12:20:11] Phil Leggetter: I think there are two ways of looking at it. Yes, our system can deliver stuff in Real-Time if you hook your components up correctly. But, just being able to enable push data in any application without setting up any infrastructure is a really big thing - to me anyway.<br />
[12:21:21] Adam DeWeb: oh ok, I thought our key differentiator (or whatever the marketing people say) was going to be that our thing is "real" real time and the rest isn't, but that's a good selling point as well. Probably better actually<br />
[12:22:07] Phil Leggetter: I think our "real" real-time ability is a massive plus but the web hasn't really come around to PUSH yet so that's our first mission.<br />
[12:22:48] Adam DeWeb: cool beans<br />
[12:24:52] Phil Leggetter: Ok. This is a great example of a valuable by-product of general work: http://scrambledup.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-are-your-business-by-products.html</p></blockquote>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2010/04/02/defining-the-kwwika-api.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: Hang on a minute. You've not explained what <em>Kwwika</em> is!</strong><br />
In a really <a href="http://nur.ph/ih7pgw">informative chat using Nurph</a>, which has been really useful in getting feedback, it was pointed out to me by <a href="http://nur.ph/users/rythie">@rythie</a> and <a href="http://nur.ph/users/neilcauldwell">@NeilCauldwell</a> that I need to explain what problem Kwwika is trying to solve before asking what the API should look like.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-kwwika?"><a href="#why-do-we-need-kwwika?">Why do we need Kwwika?</a></h2>
<p>There are loads of real-time technologies available at the moment. Almost all of them have a reasonable learning curve and require a developer to sort out server infrastructure, perform installation, do all sort of configuration and then finally get around to writing an application. In the same way that a lot of developers or organisations have moved into managed hosting for their websites, or more recently moved a lot of their IT infrastructure into the Cloud, Kwwika offers a managed and scalable real-time infrastructure so you can concentrate on building your <a href="/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html">Real-Time Rich Internet Application</a>.</p>
<p>The way I'm describing Kwwika at the moment is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kwwika is a real-time web data sharing platform with APIs in JavaScript, Silveright, .NET, Java and C.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="an-example-of-where-kwwika-could-be-used"><a href="#an-example-of-where-kwwika-could-be-used">An example of where Kwwika could be used</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.caplin.com/author/martintcaplincom/">Martin Tyler</a> recently wrote a <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2010/02/24/when-were-you-when-tendulkar-scored-200/">blog post</a> that provides a great example of where a service like Kwwika would have been really useful. In the situation described in the blog post <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/">CricInfo</a> could simply publish their cricket updates to their defined topic in Kwwika, maybe <em>/CRICINFO/GAMES/INDIA-SOUTHAFRICA/</em>, from a single server. They would then add a small piece of script to their game web page that subscribes to this topic and updates that web page whenever any new data is available. Users would see the real-time in-page updates and would no longer continue to hit "Refresh" to see if the score had updated. Kwwika would instead take the hit of the data transfer and push the live updates to the web page. This would take a massive load off of the CricInfo server and clearly save them a lot of time and infrastructure costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-i-use-kwwika?"><a href="#how-will-i-use-kwwika?">How will I use Kwwika?</a></h2>
<p>When we launch Kwwika all you'll need to do to use the service is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register for Kwwika via a sign up page</li>
<li>Define your topics that you would like to publish data to in the Kwwika dashboard e.g. <em>/PhilLeggetter/Kwwika</em></li>
<li>Find some topics with information on that you are interested in using e.g. <em>/BBC/NEWS/SPORT/FOOTBALL</em> (doesn't exist - just an example - but how cool would that be!)</li>
<li>Embed the Kwwika &lt;script&gt; tag in your web application or download the API for your chosen technology</li>
<li>Start developing your Real-Time Rich Internet Application</li>
</ol>
<ul></ul>
<p>I think the great thing about this is that developers just use the Kwwika service and only ever need to care about developing their own application. Kwwika provides the server infrastructure so you don't have to.</p>
<h2 id="the-kwwika-api"><a href="#the-kwwika-api">The Kwwika API</a></h2>
<p>I'm in the middle of defining the Kwwika API and thought this would be a great opportunity to get some early feedback. We plan to have initial releases of the API for the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Silverlight</li>
<li>C</li>
</ul>
<p>The API is really simple. It has the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect</li>
<li>Receive connection events</li>
<li>Subscribe for data</li>
<li>Receive subscription events such as errors and data updates</li>
<li>Publish data</li>
<li>Receive data publishing events (publish success or failure)</li>
<li>Disconnect</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment we have two ways of thinking about the API. The following two examples are using the JavaScript API but we plan to make the APIs virtually identical between technologies with the only differences down to following the language specific standards.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-773"></a><br />
Our main topic of discussion is around how you initiate your connection to the Kwwika service but for completeness I'll provide full examples. The first option we have is to create a <code>Connection</code> object using a factory method on the <code>kwwika</code> namespace.</p>
<p>[javascript]<br />
var oConnection = kwwika.connect({<br />
									&quot;connectionStatusUpdated&quot;:function(sStatus)<br />
									{<br />
										document.getElementById(&quot;connectionStatus&quot;).innerHTML = sStatus;<br />
									}<br />
								 });</p>
<p>var oSubscription =<br />
	oConnection.subscribe(&quot;/KWWIKA/LIBRARIES/JavaScriptAPI&quot;,<br />
						  {<br />
						  	&quot;topicUpdated&quot;:function(oSubscription, mUpdate)<br />
						  	{<br />
						  		for(var sFieldName in mUpdate)<br />
						  		{<br />
						  			document.getElementById(&quot;field_&quot; + sFieldName).innerHTML = mUpdate[sFieldName];<br />
						  		}<br />
						  	},<br />
						  	&quot;topicError&quot;:function(oSubscription, sReason)<br />
						  	{<br />
						  		var sMsg = oSubscription.topicName + &quot; error: &quot; + sReason;<br />
						  		document.getElementById(&quot;topicErrorMessage&quot;).innerHTML = sMsg;<br />
						  	});</p>
<p>oConnection.publish(&quot;/KWWIKA/LIBRARIES/JavaScriptAPI&quot;,<br />
					{<br />
						&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Phil Leggetter&quot;,<br />
						&quot;status&quot;: &quot;Getting feedback about the Kwwika API&quot;,<br />
						&quot;datetime&quot;: new Date().getTime()<br />
					},<br />
					{<br />
						&quot;commandSuccess&quot;:function(oSubscription)<br />
						{<br />
							var sMsg = oSubscription.topicName + &quot; message published.&quot;;<br />
						  	document.getElementById(&quot;publishStatus&quot;).innerHTML = sMsg;<br />
						},<br />
						&quot;commandError&quot;:function(oSubscription, sError)<br />
						{<br />
							var sMsg = oSubscription.topicName + &quot; publish error: &quot; + sError;<br />
						  	document.getElementById(&quot;publishStatus&quot;).innerHTML = sMsg;<br />
						}<br />
					});<br />
[/javascript]</p>
<p>In the second option is to create a new <code>Kwwika</code> object.</p>
<p>[javascript]<br />
var oKwwika = new Kwwika({<br />
							&quot;connectionStatusUpdated&quot;:function(sStatus)<br />
							{<br />
								document.getElementById(&quot;connectionStatus&quot;).innerHTML = sStatus;<br />
							}<br />
						 });</p>
<p>var oSubscription =<br />
	oKwwika.subscribe(&quot;/KWWIKA/LIBRARIES/JavaScriptAPI&quot;,<br />
					  {<br />
					  	&quot;topicUpdated&quot;:function(oSubscription, mUpdate)<br />
					  	{<br />
					  		for(var sFieldName in mUpdate)<br />
					  		{<br />
					  			document.getElementById(&quot;field_&quot; + sFieldName).innerHTML = mUpdate[sFieldName];<br />
					  		}<br />
					  	},<br />
					  	&quot;topicError&quot;:function(oSubscription, sReason)<br />
					  	{<br />
					  		var sMsg = oSubscription.topicName + &quot; error: &quot; + sReason;<br />
					  		document.getElementById(&quot;topicErrorMessage&quot;).innerHTML = sMsg;<br />
					  	});</p>
<p>oKwwika.publish(&quot;/KWWIKA/LIBRARIES/JavaScriptAPI&quot;,<br />
				{<br />
					&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Phil Leggetter&quot;,<br />
					&quot;status&quot;: &quot;Getting feedback about the Kwwika API&quot;,<br />
					&quot;datetime&quot;: new Date().getTime()<br />
				},<br />
				{<br />
					&quot;commandSuccess&quot;:function(oSubscription)<br />
					{<br />
						var sMsg = oSubscription.topicName + &quot; message published.&quot;;<br />
					  	document.getElementById(&quot;publishStatus&quot;).innerHTML = sMsg;<br />
					},<br />
					&quot;commandError&quot;:function(oSubscription, sError)<br />
					{<br />
						var sMsg = oSubscription.topicName + &quot; publish error: &quot; + sError;<br />
					  	document.getElementById(&quot;publishStatus&quot;).innerHTML = sMsg;<br />
					}<br />
				});<br />
[/javascript]</p>
<p>Do the above examples make sense? Is the API easy enough to use? How would you establish a connection to the Kwwika service? Would you do anything differently?</p>
<p>I'd love to get you feedback so please leave your comments below or email me directly using <a href="mailto:phil@leggetter.co.uk?subject=Defining the Kwwika API">phil@leggetter.co.uk</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This post is going to be short and sweet. “Short” because <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a> makes working around this problem so simple. And “Sweet” because I think this is really powerful and will allow you to develop applications that show why cross domain access, in some situations, should be allowed.</p>
<p>In my last post on <a href="/2010/03/12/making-cross-domain-javascript-requests-using-xmlhttprequest-or-xdomainrequest.html">Making cross domain JavaScript requests using XMLHttpRequest or XDomainRequest</a> I demonstrated that in order to access a resource (web page/web service) the server needs to respond to your application/JavaScript HTTP requests with an HTTP header of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-access-control-20080912/#access-control-allow-origin">“Access-Control-Allow-Origin”</a>. The problem arises when you are trying to access a resource that doesn’t presently send the required HTTP header, but you really need it to (I’ve addressed a similar problem to this when developing Silverlight applications and the solution, again, was to use <a href="/2009/10/30/using-fiddler-to-trick-silverlight-into-allowing-a-crossdomain-web-request.html">Fiddler to trick Silverlight into allowing a crossdomain Web Request</a>). For development purposes you’ll need to add the required header to the server HTTP response in your development environment. This is really simple using Fiddler.<br />
<span id="more-758"> </span><br />
All you need to do is add a new custom rule. You can do this via the menu option: <strong>Rules -&gt; Customize Rules…</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_759" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 409px;">
<p><a class="thickbox no_icon" title="Customize Rules" rel="gallery-758" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/CustomizeRules.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-759" title="Customize Rules" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/CustomizeRules.png" alt="" width="399" height="289" /></a></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Fiddler Customize Rules option</p>
</div>
<p>This will bring up a JScript.NET file (if you don’t like the thought of JScript you can just pretend it’s JavaScript) called <em>CustomRules.js</em>. In that file you will see a number of functions/methods that are called at certain points during an HTTP request or response. The method we are interested in is called <code>OnBeforeResponse</code> and what we want to do is to add the <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> header to trick the browser/scripting engine into thinking that the resource we are requesting allows the cross domain request.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">static function OnBeforeResponse(oSession: Session)
{
	oSession.oResponse.headers.Add("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above will add this header to all HTTP responses. You can of course add an <code>if</code> statement so that the header is only added when a particular condition is matched, such as a responses from <a href="/">https://www.leggetter.co.uk</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">static function OnBeforeResponse(oSession: Session)
{
	if (oSession.HostNameIs("www.leggetter.co.uk"))
	{
		oSession.oResponse.headers.Add("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p><small>The code snippet above has not been tested</small></p>
<p>Once you have added your code to the <code>OnBeforeResponse</code> method you can save and close the CustomRules.js file. Fiddler will detect that this file has been modified and compile it in the background so that it can use the new code with each request and response that it processes.</p>
<p>The next time that Fiddler is processing an HTTP response it will call this method, your code will run, and the <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> HTTP header added to the response.</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 2010 11:04:51 GMT
Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Expires: Fri, 19 Mar 2010 11:03:51 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
</code></pre>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Cross domain requests (also known as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/">Cross Origin Resource Sharing</a>) can be made using JavaScript without trickery, as far as I can tell, in <strong>Firefox 3.5</strong>, <strong>Safari</strong>,<strong> Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Internet Explorer 8</strong>. This is done with all browsers except IE8 using a standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XMLHttpRequest</a> object. The only thing required to notify the browser that JavaScript is allowed to make this request is for the server to send a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-access-control-20080912/#access-control-allow-origin">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a> response header. Internet Explorer 8 uses an object called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288060(VS.85).aspx">XDomainRequest</a> and requires the same HTTP header. If the value of the header is * then requests are allowed from all domains. You can be more restrictive if required.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-741"></a><br />
I took the code that I'll use below from this <a href="http://arunranga.com/examples/access-control/">CORS in action page</a> but I couldn't find the code required to make this work in Internet Explorer so I've had to modify things a bit.</p>
<h2 id="see-it-in-action"><a href="#see-it-in-action">See it in action</a></h2>

<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/xss/simple.js"></script>

<form id="controlsToInvoke" action="">

  <input type="button" value="Click to Invoke Another Site" onclick="callOtherDomain()" />
</p>
</form>
<div id="textDiv">
  The information below (when it appears) has been fetched using cross-site XHR.
</div>

<h2 id="the-code"><a href="#the-code">The code</a></h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  var isIE8 = window.XDomainRequest ? true : false;
  var invocation = createCrossDomainRequest();
  var url = 'https://leggetter-cors.herokuapp.com/';
  function createCrossDomainRequest(url, handler) {
    var request;
    if (isIE8) {
      request = new window.XDomainRequest();
      }
      else {
        request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      }
    return request;
  }

  function callOtherDomain() {
    if (invocation) {
      if(isIE8) {
        invocation.onload = outputResult;
        invocation.open("GET", url, true);
        invocation.send();
      }
      else {
        invocation.open('GET', url, true);
        invocation.onreadystatechange = handler;
        invocation.send();
      }
    }
    else {

      var textNode = document.createTextNode(text);
      var textDiv = document.getElementById("textDiv");
      textDiv.appendChild(textNode);
    }
  }

  function handler(evtXHR) {

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="textDiv"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<p>And this is the code on the server</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

  $uri = 'http'. ($_SERVER['HTTPS'] ? 's' : null) .'://'. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Real-Time Web!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Web!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Web!</strong></p>
<p>Like me you may well be fed up of hearing and seeing this term. However, I'm guessing that you'll be fed up for a different reason to me. I'm actually very excited about the real-time web (I'm sure you'll have noticed) but I want to see it used as more than just a buzz term. I want to see real-time used in the true sense of the term - to mean that something has happened within the last few milliseconds. I want it to mean that the tweet you are reading, the picture you are viewing, the status update you are reading, the event you are being notified of is happening <strong>NOW</strong>.</p>

<p>Google no longer takes days to index a web site or find a new blog post. For things like blog posts, new web sites, certain types of news and future events it doesn't really matter if we only find out about them within hours of their availability. But with other things such as live events, breaking news and opportunities, seconds, and sometimes milliseconds, really do matter.</p>
<p>When does instant real-time matter? When do you need to be informed that something is happening now? When do seconds, or even milliseconds, really matter?</p>
<p>Here are a few examples that I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live events</strong> - notifications related to live events completely lose their context if they are delivered too late. With live events seconds matter. If there is a system using the live event notifications, such as a betting platform them milliseconds matter. As soon as a goal is scored in a football match betting needs to be temporarily stopped until the odds can be updated to take into account the new scoreline. A good example of this is <a href="http://football.picklive.com/">PickLive Football</a> (previously Football 3's).</li>
<li><strong>Alarm notifications</strong> - If you have a system hooked into your house alarm, or a power system alarm then delivery of the alarm notification needs to be instantaneous so that it can be quickly acted upon. So, a firm such as <a href="http://alertme.com/">AlertMe</a> would probably be very interested.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong> - If you check in to a cafe using a platform such as <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Four Square</a> or <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> then there is a finite amount of time during which that location update will be valid. During that time there is opportunity for people to meet up with you. Another example might be that an unscheduled event is all of a sudden is taking place. Without instant notification of that event you would miss it.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration and communication</strong> - Good examples of this are instant messaging and <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/">Google Wave</a>. I'm sure there are loads of other platforms out there where instant updates are required to ensure that people aren't left waiting for a reply and don't spend time composing a replies that are irrelevant or out of date.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love to get your feedback on this so <strong>please leave you comments and ideas below</strong>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm doing my best to keep up to speed on any news related to the real-time web. I follow interesting people on Twitter who tweet out links, I subscribe to RSS feeds and I've got <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> set up on a number of phrases. Since I'm doing all this work I thought it would be a good idea to start sharing it by publishing the findings in an occasional summary blog post. I generally don't like blog posts which just say "this is an interesting article" but sometimes, if it raises awareness of good articles, it can be useful. Hopefully it will be.</p>
<p>I tend to first post the links on the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?&amp;gid=2578818">Real-Time Web Software and Technologies LinkedIn group</a> so if you are interested on getting the news as I find it, or contributing your own real-time web finds then please join <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?&amp;gid=2578818">the group</a>. Also feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter">Tweet at me</a> or <a href="/contact-me">contact me via the website</a> if you find anything interesting and relevant.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just come across <a href="http://stage.vambenepe.com/">William Vambenepe's blog</a> and an article called "<a href="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1284">Waiting for events (in Cloud APIs)</a>" where he discusses how an event system is missing from cloud vendor APIs.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-720 alignleft" title="Notification - event" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/notification_event.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="216" /> With my interest in Comet I straight away thought of this as a solution to the notification requirement and it's interesting that the article goes on to talk about subscription management and then moves on to thinking about the delivery mechanism which are all key aspects of a good comet implementation:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1284"><p>How do you deliver notifications? Do you keep HTTP connections open through tricks similar to how self-updating web pages work (e.g. COMET, long polling and soon WebSockets)? Or do you just provide a listener endpoint to which the notifier tries to connect (which, in the case of public cloud deployments, means you need to have a publicly-addressable listener, but hopefully not on the same Cloud infrastructure). Do you use XMPP? AMQP? Email? Can I have you hold my events and let me come pull them?</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-719"></a>However, when considering a notification system such as this you need to consider <strong>how frequently</strong> events would actually occur. How often would a new virtual machine in the cloud be spun up? How frequently do virtual machines unexpectedly crash? In relation to events in other scenarios such as stock rate updates or events within the <a href="http://www.premierleague.com">Premier League</a> between 15:00 and 17:00 on a Saturday, probably not all that frequently.</p>
<p>You also need to think about <strong>what would be consuming the event</strong>. Would it be an application with a user interface that prompts the user to take action or would it be an application with built in logic to handle a virtual machine failure event? If the application is running on a server then there is no reason why that server couldn't be informed of the event via a single call to a web service, or maybe using something such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PUbSubHubbub</a>, rather than holding open a connection to the cloud API - William describes this as a "listener endpoint". If the application consuming the event is a web application, maybe the application is the cloud vendors VM dashboard, then Comet would be an ideal choice for instant notification.</p>
<p>Frequency of events and the event consuming application are two key things to consider when thinking about the best way to distribute and consume events using real-time web technologies. As an event-based API developer you may need to consider distributing your events in a number of ways to give application developers the choice.</p>
<p>Are there any notification systems out there that can be used by an API developer to easily distribute events in either way?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_takes_first_shot_at_facebook_search_results.php">this article</a> by Read Write Web, Bing have exclusive access to the data created by Facebook user status updates and Google have access to the data from Facebook fan page updates. It's interesting to see that this data is so highly valued that there is clearly a bidding war over access to certain types of data. <strong>Which is more valuable?</strong></p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_takes_first_shot_at_facebook_search_results.php"><p>As of today, Facebook Fan Page status updates will begin appearing in Google search results, according to <a href="http://twitter.com/google/status/9599921440">a tweet</a> by Google. The announcement means that we will begin seeing results from the nearly 3 million fan pages, but not from the more than 400 million users.</p></blockquote>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've started building a <a href="/cloud-hosting-platform-as-a-service-vendors-list">list of cloud hosting vendors</a>, including those offering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">platform as a service (PAAS)</a>. I'm trying to get vendors to contribute but as yet haven't been too successful. I'll need to directly approach them over the next few weeks to see if they'd be willing to provide me with a few details.</p>
<p><strong>Update 27/02/2010:</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesbirchmore">good friend of mine</a> found a <a href="http://www.cloudxl.com/">website</a> that lists all cloud vendors. Although it doesn't contain all technology specific information that I was looking for it's quite a comprehensive list and a good starting point. Check out <a href="http://www.cloudxl.com/">cloudxl</a>.</p>
<p>You can still view my original list too:</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It would appear that the Silverlight runtime <a href="http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/135096/301578.aspx">creates a file named XCP*.tmp of around 20MB within a users %temp% directory</a> (where * can be replaced by random characters). This file would appear to be used in some way by the Silverlight runtime for web requests. If you refresh your Silverlight application then this file is cleaned up. However, if your web request is interrupted in some way then the file can be left in your %temp% directory slowly but surely eating up disk space.</p>
<p>This is particularly noticeable and reproducible if you are using the HttpWebRequest class to stream data (for more <a href="/2010/01/03/msdn-e-book-and-podcast.html">information on streaming data from Silverlight you can listen to my podcast and read my article in a free MSDN book</a>). You can then reproduce the loss of connection using <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a> (which seriously rocks and is becoming more and more useful) by right-clicking on the streaming connection and selecting "Abort Session".</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_695" align="alignnone" width="529" caption="Fiddler - Abort Session"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/FiddlerAbortSession.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-695 " title="Fiddler - Abort Session" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/FiddlerAbortSession.png" alt="" width="529" height="294" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>The best solution to resolve this that I've found is to manually invoke the garbage collector whenever you detect the connection loss.</p>
<p>[csharp]<br />
// Manually invoke Garbage collection<br />
GC.Collect();</p>
<p>[/csharp]</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/12/22/thoughts-on-the-techcrunch-christmascrunch-xmascrunch.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/06/techcrunch-europe-christmascrunch-its-a-realtime-holiday/">TechCrunch ChristmasCrunch</a> which came with the tagline “It’s a realtime holiday”. It’s great to see so many companies embracing the real-time web and building their businesses around it. Some companies that you would still class as start-ups such as <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>, <a href="http://seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> and <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/">tweetmeme</a> are now relatively established and there were a dozen or more startup pitches with the majority of these new companies focusing on the real-time web.</p>
<p>There’s so much data being generated by social networks that it wasn’t surprising that a lot of the focus was around analysing the data. The key words from the event in relation to the data were <strong>relevance</strong>, <strong>sentiment</strong>, <strong>curation</strong>, <strong>authority</strong> and <strong>location</strong>. All of these terms play off each other. <strong>Relevance</strong> can be determined by authority and location. <strong>Sentiment</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>authority</strong> can be determined by a curation process. Some solutions to curation pitched at the event were based on language and text analysis, whilst others suggested crowdsourcing and using manual intervention as a means of determining the quality of data.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-619"></a><br />
Of all the presentations, panels and startup pitches there was not all that much time spent talking about underlying technology used by any of the companies. <a href="http://jameswhittaker.co.uk/">James Whittaker</a> of TweetDeck reiterated <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2834854">Iain Dodsworths words from Le Web</a> in saying TweetDeck would stay with the Adobe Air platform. He also mentioned that they were looking forward to the version 2.0 release of Air – I wish I’d asked why. <a href="http://twitter.com/Marco">Marco Kaiser</a> of Seesmic, in my eyes TweetDeck’s main rival, talked about moving to the Windows platform to increase application performance and provide a plugin development framework. Other than that the only other mention of technology that I can remember were a couple of mentions of PUSH by David Maher Roberts of <a href="http://www.thefilter.com/">The Filter</a>, who said none of their clients were using PUSH at the moment but there were requests in place and a POC ongoing, and <a href="http://twitter.com/thetimmorgan">Tim Morgan</a> of <a href="http://mintdigital.com/">Mint Digital</a> who have recently released <a href="http://football3s.com/">Football3’s</a> which clearly relies on true real-time in order to be interactive.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting event and I’m really pleased that I attended but I would really have liked to have gained some insight into the technologies that companies are using and would have liked to see people talking about and moving to “real-time” in the true sense of the term rather than it being used as a marketing term.</p>
<p>You can view <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/12/16/xmascrunch-speakers-and-pitches-in-video/">videos of most of the presentations on TechCrunch</a>. Look out for one lady finding it particularly funny when I went to ask Marco of Seesmic a question and introduced myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi, I'm Phil Leggetter and I'm a Real-Time Web Software Consultant... I just made that up!
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a joke, I really am a "Real-Time Web Software Consultant", but I thought it might be quite funny, but not THAT funny. You can see this at just after 7:00 on this video:<br />

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/12/12/how-does-google-real-time-search-work.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/12/12/how-does-google-real-time-search-work.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On or around the 12th of December 2009 Google released a feature they are calling "real-time search".</p>
<blockquote cite="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/relevance-meets-real-time-web.html"><p>Our real-time search enables you to discover breaking news the moment it's happening, even if it's not the popular news of the day, and even if you didn't know about it beforehand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I'd still argue that we're not seeing the real-time web with this solution I thought I'd go in to a bit of detail about how Google are achieving this HTTP polling solution.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Google are consuming and indexing real-time data from multiple social networks</li>
<li>It's not real-time HTTP PUSH yet, it's HTTP PULL using a polling interval</li>
<li>The polling interval seems to vary but this needs to be confirmed.</li>
<li>The polling result returns an encoded JSON response containing the next request to be made and the HTML of any new results. These results are injected into the "Latest results" section of the page</li>
<li>The HTML returned is quite verbose and could be refined</li>
<li>87% from a sample of 30 polled requests returned no new results meaning the request was a waste of resources</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-600"></a></p>
<h2 id="data-sources"><a href="#data-sources">Data Sources</a></h2>
<p>Google now has an agreement in place with Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, FriendFeed, Identi.ca and Jaiku to consume and index their real-time data and make the results available in a "Latest Results" section of the Google search results. A number of social networks have APIs and some of these APIs have a real-time streaming feed and it's likely that Google is simply connecting to this. For example, MySpace have <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2009/12/08/opening-the-flood-gates-and-unleashing-the-data.aspx">released a Real-Time Stream API</a> and Twitter has a Firehose feed, both of which Google will be using in their real-time search results. The Twitter Firehose feed is <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/FAQ#CanIhavetheFirehose">"not generally available"</a> at the moment but Ryan Sarver, who is Director of Platform at Twitter, <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2748326">announced at Le Web</a> that the Firehose stream would become generally available in the future.<br />

<h2 id="how-google-put-the-real-time-data-into-their-search-results?"><a href="#how-google-put-the-real-time-data-into-their-search-results?">How Google put the real-time data into their search results?</a></h2>
<p>Since Google now have access to the data as soon as it is generated by the social network the next thing they need to do is get that into your search results. As soon as you make your search Google can put information that has just become available straight into the page. However, how do they get information that becomes available after your search results page has already loaded? Simple. They poll for new results regular intervals (as I mentioned in my <a href="/2009/12/09/how-real-time-does-real-time-have-to-be.html">How real-time does real-time have to be?</a> blog post). So far I've seen a 20 second polling interval but recently, with a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%23leweb">search for #leweb</a>, I've seen a 30 second polling interval. It's possible that they may have an idea how likely it is that your search subject will have new information available and change this polling interval accordingly.</p>
<p>These polling search requests look like this:</p>
<pre>
http://www.google.co.uk/realtimejs?q=%23leweb
&amp;hl=en
&amp;polltype=mb
&amp;since=1260622409000000

[/code]<br />
The response is an encoded JSON response and contains two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>nextRequest</strong>: The next polling search request to make</li>
<li><strong>results</strong>: An Array of Encoded HTML for any results that have been found for the current polling request.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the example response above we get a next request of:<br />
[code]<br />
/realtimejs?<br />
q\\x3d%23leweb\\x26hl\\x3den\\x26output\\x3dsearch\\x26since\\x3d1260623734161591\\x26sessionstart\\x3d1260623385000000\\x26ei\\x3dbpgjS5zOG8j54Ab5kMzpCQ\\x26usg\\x3d3760<br />
[/code]<br />
Which translates to the following URL:</p>
<pre>
http://www.google.co.uk/realtimejs?q=%23leweb&amp;hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;since=1260623734161591&amp;sessionstart=1260623385000000&amp;ei=bpgjS5zOG8j54Ab5kMzpCQ&amp;usg=3760
</pre>
<p>From looking at the parameters it would appear that the <strong>since</strong> parameter would be very useful and would allow you to retrieve historical updates.</p>
<p>Each encoded HTML result in the results array will be decoded on the client using JavaScript and injected into the "Latest Results" section within the search result listings. It's quite surprising that they return quite so much encoded HTML content and not just the information and then generate the HTML on the client. I suppose this is a new feature and it will be refined over time.</p>
<p>One point worth mentioning is that because Google are using a polling technique they are performing a lot of HTTP PULL requests to the server that return no results. This is a wasted request. From a sample size of 30 polled requests only 4 requests actually returned new results. This means that 87% of requests are a complete waste of resources.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Last night, just over 12 hours ago, I attended the <a href="http://sproutuplondon.eventbrite.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk Crush It event</a> organised by <a href="http://sprouter.com/">Sprouter</a> in London. I’ve already read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0061914177?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0061914177">Crush It</a> and seen a lot of <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary online</a> so I wondered if he would give out any information that I hadn’t already heard. On the way in I mentioned this to <a href="http://iansanders.com/">Ian Sanders</a> who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s always different live. It’s like a gig.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a big statement considering the event is just a guy standing and speaking and taking some Q&amp;A. However, Ian’s statement was spot-on. Gary oozes charisma and when he speaks it feels like he’s addressing you directly. This is clearly one of the reasons why he’s so popular and doing so well.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_592" align="alignnone" width="480" caption="Gary Vaynerchuk at the Sprouter Crush It event"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMAGE_205.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-592" title="Gary Vaynerchuk" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMAGE_205.jpg" alt="Gary Vaynerchuk at the Sprouter Crush It event" width="480" height="640" /></a>[/caption]<br />

<p>One of the things that Gary covered, and I’ve heard him mention a few times now, was <strong>small town rules</strong>. My take on what Gary means that social media has made a global community possible. He provided a couple of examples.</p>
<h3 id="example-1:-small-town"><a href="#example-1:-small-town">Example 1: Small Town</a></h3>
<p>You can go out in New York, get drunk and get naked every night of the week and it most probably won’t impact your reputation. However, in a small town if you do this just once it will.</p>
<h3 id="example-2:-small-town-effect-through-social-media"><a href="#example-2:-small-town-effect-through-social-media">Example 2: Small Town effect through Social Media</a></h3>
<p>The movie Bruno (I'm not giving it a link, I've heard it's <em>that</em> bad) had one of the biggest attendances for an opening night in the states. However, the second night had the biggest drop off in attendances ever. This is because on the first night people left half way through and wrote on Twitter and Facebook how terrible the movie was. In 24 hours word had got out to avoid this movie at all costs.</p>
<p>What has this got to do with the Real-Time web I hear you ask? Well, in the first small town example it’s easy to see why and how news spreads so quickly. In a small town it doesn’t take long for news like this to spread. But in the second example the news spreads to a massive number of people because of the real-time web effect introduced by the immediate availability of information from networks such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>I managed to get a question in and asked Gary:</p>
<blockquote><p>How real-time does real-time have to be? For example, the newly introduced Google real-time search checks every 20 seconds to see if any more relevant search results are available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst Gary said that 20 seconds was probably alright he did suggest that this would be fine until another site provided the results in 19 seconds, and ultimately 0 seconds. At which point expectation would be changed.</p>
<p>This has encouraged me to continue my <strong>push</strong> to encourage the uptake of technology to provide a truly real-time web experience. Data is available instantly so why not push it to users instantly. Is 20 seconds really good enough when technology is out there to allow that information to be pushed to us in closer to 0 seconds? My opinion is: <strong>C'mon Google, you can do better!</strong></p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/12/01/the-christmascrunch-nearly-real-time-web-event.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On the 15th of December I’m going to the <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/06/techcrunch-europe-christmascrunch-its-a-realtime-holiday/">ChristmasCrunch</a>. It looks like a really good event with Iain Dodsworth and James Whittaker of <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> giving the keynote on “Where the biggest realtime desktop application goes next” (I know where I'm hoping it goes. See below). Other presentations include Jenni Lees of <a href="http://festbuzz.com/">Festbuzz</a>, Marco Kaiser of <a href="http://seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a>, Mario Menti of <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a>, Mark Rock of <a href="http://audioboo.fm/">AudioBoo</a>, Nick Halstead of <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/">Tweetmeme</a>, Daniel Tenner of <a href="https://www.woobius.com/">Woobius</a>, Willian Fischer of <a href="http://www.twitterjobsearch.com/">Twitter Jobsearch</a> and Tim Morgan of <a href="http://mintdigital.com/">Mint Digital</a>. And if that’s not enough there’s also a startup pitch (<a href="http://leggetter.posterous.com/is-the-startup-pitch-the-only-way">startup pitches - grrrr...</a>) and an after party.</p>
<p>My main interest in this event is to see if anybody is going to start delivering a “truly real-time” experience to users. Will TweetDeck still be making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_technology">polling requests</a> to the various services it uses to check if any more data is available or will they move to using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology">PUSH technology</a>? Are other companies going to start adopting PUSH to give the user a <strong>truly real-time web experience</strong>?</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-580"></a></p>
<p>I’ve already mentioned my opinion <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">time</a> and <a href="/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html">time</a> and <a href="/2009/11/14/why-comet-is-key-to-the-truly-real-time-web.html">time again</a> that what we presently see as the real-time web isn’t in fact giving any of us a truly real-time experience, and this won’t be the case until data is pushed to us in real-time. If we have to actively check to see if there is new data available then how can anybody claim that we are receiving data in real-time? As soon as the new data is available we should not only be informed about that new data, but also given it.</p>
<p><strong>Let me use Google search as an example:</strong> Google is getting really good at almost instantly picking up new content on the web – what everybody is calling the “real-time web” experience. I’ve also observed that it looks like they’ve started to rank new content higher, so they are really embracing and valuing the freshness of information.  If I were to go to Google.com and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Real+Time+Rich+Internet+Applications">search for “Real-Time Rich Internet Applications”</a> I’d get a number of relevant and potentially fresh results.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_581" align="alignnone" caption="Real Time Rich Internet Application Google Search Results"]<img class="size-full wp-image-581" title="Real Time Rich Internet Application Google Search Results" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/RTRIASearchResult.png" alt="Real Time Rich Internet Application Google Search Results" width="500" />[/caption]</p>
<p>If just after Google returns these results to me <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a> decides that <a title="Real-Time Rich Internet Applications" href="/tag/rtria">RTRIA</a>s are the next big and publishes a blog post on the subject, leading to a number of other blog posts and tweets, I’d be none the wiser until I resubmit my search to see the updated results. Google would no doubt pick up this new, high profile bloggers, blog post and it would be available, maybe even top in the search listings, when I next searched for “Real-Time Rich Internet Applications”. But, I’ve done my search and I’d believe that I have got the most relevant information available at that moment so my search results would be out of date.</p>
<p>Until companies move away from the old <strong>PULL</strong> web model and move to <strong>PUSH</strong> we are going to be stuck with a <strong>nearly-real-time web experience</strong>. I hope I get the opportunity to ask a few people at the ChristmasCrunch about <strong>when</strong>, not <strong>if</strong>, they will be moving to a PUSH model to deliver a <strong>truly real-time web experience</strong> to their users.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/11/14/why-comet-is-key-to-the-truly-real-time-web.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/11/14/why-comet-is-key-to-the-truly-real-time-web.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A lot of websites use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)#Ajax_with_long_polling">HTTP Polling</a> to update data on on their website or application without the need for the user refreshing the website. This is clearly better than a purely static page, but during the time between each poll the data on the page has the potential of being out of date (stale) so to make a decision based on the information on a potentially stale page can be a risky one.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/HTTP_Streaming#Goal_Story">normal example</a> given to show the benefits of using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a> to achieve full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#HTTP_server_push">HTTP streaming</a> and the importance of non-stale data is of a trader making a trade on an out of date price. Another example is given where a person places a bet using odds that are on screen but do not match up with the odds in the betting system.</p>
<p>I just read a <a href="http://cometdaily.com/2009/11/14/comet-support-for-iis/">post on Comet Daily</a> about a company called <a href="http://www.frozenmountain.com/">Frozen Mountain</a> who have just released <a href="http://www.frozenmountain.com/websync/">a component that adds Comet Support for IIS</a>. Along with this they've released a <a href="/2009/11/14/why-comet-is-key-to-the-real-time-web.html">video</a> which doesn't cover the standard example.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-565"></a><br />
<a name="comet-example-video"></a><br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="270" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4748722&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="270" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4748722&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" />&lt;/embed&gt;</object></p>
<p>It's possible that in this example that a polling solution might actually be just as suitable but this is a good demonstration of the benefits of Comet. In the example Comet provides almost instant feedback on the number of available tickets to potential buyers. This has two benefits. The first is that the user (Bob in the video) has less of a chance of missing out on his tickets. The second is more of a commercial benefit in that the user gets instant feedback on the popularity of the event and availability of the tickets and is more likely to make an instant purchase.</p>
<p>Until a solution such as Comet is used the data that a user sees, in a event booking, trading, betting or even search system, cannot be classed as part of the <strong>truly real-time web</strong>.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/11/07/which-rich-internet-application-technology-will-dominate.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/11/07/which-rich-internet-application-technology-will-dominate.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been a member of the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=112239&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm">RIA Developers Group</a> on LinkedIn for a short while now and the other day <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/patrickbay">Patrick Bay</a> posted a link to an interesting <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/11/04/238406/rich-internet-applications-come-to-the-fore.htm">article on Computer Weekly</a> about the prominence of RIAs. A few comments were posted and then Patrick questioned which RIAs would "bubble to the top".</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the UI revolution's already here; now we see which ones bubble to the top!</p></blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about the criteria that may determine which RIA technology would be most successful.</p>
<p>I think there are a number of things that will determine which one will ultimately win, or at least become the dominant choice. At the moment I can think of three categories; <a href="/2009/11/07which-rich-internet-application-technology-will-dominate.html#technology-buy-in">Technology buy-in</a>, <a href="/2009/11/07which-rich-internet-application-technology-will-dominate.html#development-environment">Development environment</a> and <a href="/2009/11/07which-rich-internet-application-technology-will-dominate.html#data-access-capabilities-and-choice">Data access capabilities and choice</a>.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-534"></a><br />
<a name="technology-buy-in"></a></p>
<h2 id="technology-buy-in"><a href="#technology-buy-in">Technology buy-in</a></h2>
<p>Some companies buy-in to a technology because they have always used that technology. For example, a company that have always used Java will be more likely to opt for the Adobe solution where they can write their server components using Java and their client in Flash/ActionScript/<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a> (<em>this terminology is still a bit unclear to me. I think this is why Adobe are renaming Flex Builder to Flash Builder</em>) but a company that have traditionally used Microsoft products will undoubtedly go for <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>. More traditional web developers, who probably build upon the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(solution_stack)">LAMP stack</a>, that have been hand coding PHP on the server and JavaScript on the client tend to go for creating RIAs using Ajax.<br />
<a name="development-environment"></a></p>
<h2 id="development-environment"><a href="#development-environment">Development environment</a></h2>
<p>I believe that Microsoft have a massive advantage in having <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-gb/products/professional/default.mspx">Visual Studio</a> as a server and client IDE. It has it's faults but in general it's a fantastic development environment. Those choosing Flex (Java -&gt; ActionScript/Flash) will more than likely choose the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>, which is powerful, but it's ActionScript/Flex development tools are lacking maturity. I've recently used the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashbuilder4/">Flash Builder 4 beta</a> and it's miles behind Visual Studio in terms of coding productivity features. I've heard that the Flex UI component development features may be better than Visual Studio's support for Silverlight UI. The LAMP with Ajax stack suffers much the same problems as Flex with, as far as I know, Eclipse being the IDE of choice and client-side productivity tools still very much in their infancy. It's clearly very difficult to write an IDE to enhance JavaScript/Ajax productivity.</p>
<div class="information">I quite frequently develop JavaScript in Eclipse using the <a href="http://www.aptana.org/">Aptana</a> plugin so I'd be interested in getting suggestions on other Ajax IDE choices.</div>
<p><a name="data-access-capabilities-and-choice"></a></p>
<h2 id="data-access-capabilities-and-choice"><a href="#data-access-capabilities-and-choice">Data access capabilities and choice</a></h2>
<p>I think this has been one of the last things to be considered in the RIA stack. Previously browsers have locked down where you can get your data from. Developers were always trying to implement hacks to allow them to do things such as make a web request to a server on a different domain or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a> to implement <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/HTTP_Streaming">HTTP streaming</a>. As the web has opened up to the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">Mashups</a>, browser and RIA plugin vendors have had to change their stance on cross site security. It's a difficult line to walk but I believe that the technology that makes retrieving data from multiple sources the easiest, without having to go via a proxy, will have a distinct advantage. Flash and Silverlight are winning the race at the moment with Silverlight's use of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645032(VS.95).aspx">security policy files</a> and Flash's support for <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ActionScript/3.0_ProgrammingAS3/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b90204-7e08.html#WS366737CC-0BD3-47b4-8292-569FB3AA276B">master policy files</a>. For the Ajax solution I still need to research information on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control">HTTP cross domain access control</a> headers and which browsers have implemented support for them. I still think there will be an argument for mashing up your data on the server and I have a blog post planned on <a href="/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html">RTRIA</a> server technologies.</p>
<p>The important questions around RIA data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which RIA will be more efficient at consuming data?</li>
<li>Which one will prove to be the most capable as a <a href="/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html">Real-Time Rich Internet Application (RTRIA)</a>?</li>
<li>Will RIA technology vendors try to lock developers into using a client-server technology stack, such as Adobe may be trying to do with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/dataservices/">LCDS</a> and Flex, and will this put developers off?</li>
<li>Is decoupling of server and client technology, and communication protocol, important? I think it is, do you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although RIAs have been around for a while now, as Patrick said, the race to dominate the Rich Internet Application Technology space is on.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just had an article published in the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/aa570311.aspx">UK MSDN Flash newsletter</a> on <strong>How to consume real-time data in a Silverlight RIA</strong>. As part of writing up the article I developed a sample <a title="Real-Time Rich Internet Application" href="/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html">Real-Time Rich Internet Application (RTRIA)</a> that consumes real-time data from the <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation">Twitter real-time data feed</a>. I also put together my first ever <a href="/2009/11/03/a-real-time-rich-internet-application-rtria-example.html#screencast">screencast</a>. So, you can start by <a href="/2009/11/03/a-real-time-rich-internet-application-rtria-example.html#code">getting hold of the code</a> or <a href="/2009/11/03/a-real-time-rich-internet-application-rtria-example.html#screencast">watching the screencast</a>.</p>
<p><a name="code"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-code"><a href="#the-code">The Code</a></h2>
<p>First, and this is <strong>Important</strong>:</p>
<div class="important">To get the sample application to stream real-time data from the Twitter real-time feed you will need to <a href="/2009/10/30/using-fiddler-to-trick-silverlight-into-allowing-a-crossdomain-web-request.html">use Fiddler to trick Silverlight into allowing a crossdomain Web Request</a>.</div>
<p>Now that you are aware of that, you will also need the Silverlight development environment. You can get everything you need via the <a href="http://silverlight.net/getstarted/">Silverlight Getting Started page</a>.</p>
<p>You've now got everything you need to run the <em>RTRIA</em> example. To run the sample application you should set the <em>MSDNFlashRTRIAExample.Web</em> project as the startup project and the <em>MSDNFlashRTRIAExampleTestPage.html</em> page as the startup page.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_488" align="alignnone" width="335" caption="Setting up the solution to run the application"]<img class="size-full wp-image-488" title="Setting up the solution to run the application" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SetupForRunning.png" alt="Setting up the solution to run the application" width="335" height="264" />[/caption]</p>
<p>If you'd like to find out a bit more about the code then read on. If you'd rather jump straight into the code you can download it from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tweetstreamer/">TweetStreamer Google Code project</a>.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-423"></a></p>
<h3 id="the-streaming-connection"><a href="#the-streaming-connection">The streaming connection</a></h3>
<p>The following extracts of code may be slightly modified but that has been done to be able to explain what the code does in general a bit better.</p>
<p>The following extract is used to establish a connection to the Twitter real-time data stream using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest(VS.95).aspx">HttpWebRequest</a>. The important thing to note is the use of <code>request.AllowReadStreamBuffering = false;</code> which is required since we are requesting a streaming feed. Without setting the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest.allowreadstreambuffering(VS.95).aspx">AllowReadStreamBuffering</a> property to <code>false</code> the <code>ConnectionResponseCallback</code> callback will not be invoked because the response will be continuously buffering.</p>
<p>Since the Twitter real-time data stream requires authentication, and we can't set <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest.credentials(VS.95).aspx">Credentials</a> on the <code>HttpWebRequest</code> in Silverlight, the browser will prompt the user for a username and password.<br />
[csharp]<br />
private const string SPRITZER_URL = &quot;http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json&quot;;</p>
<p>/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />
/// Starts the connection to the Twitter real-time data stream.<br />
/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />
public void Connect()<br />
{<br />
    this.InternalConnectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Connecting;</p>
<p>    try<br />
    {<br />
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(new Uri(SPRITZER_URL));<br />
        request.AllowReadStreamBuffering = false;<br />
        request.BeginGetResponse(ConnectionResponseCallback, request);<br />
    }<br />
    catch (Exception ex)<br />
    {<br />
        Debug.WriteLine(ex);<br />
        this.InternalConnectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Disconnected;<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]</p>
<p>Within the callback method we ensure that we are connected and then call the <code>ReadResponseStream</code> method which will not return until we call <code>Disconnect()</code>.</p>
<p>[csharp]<br />
/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />
/// Called when the initial connection has been established.<br />
/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />
private void ConnectionResponseCallback(IAsyncResult asynchronousResult)<br />
{<br />
    try<br />
    {<br />
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)asynchronousResult.AsyncState;<br />
        using (HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.EndGetResponse(asynchronousResult))<br />
        {<br />
            if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK)<br />
            {<br />
                this.InternalConnectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Connected;</p>
<p>                this.ReadResponseStream(request, response);</p>
<p>                if (this.InternalConnectionStatus != ConnectionStatus.Disconnecting)<br />
                {<br />
                    // unexpected status<br />
                    Debug.WriteLine(&quot;unexpected connection status: &quot; + this.InternalConnectionStatus);<br />
                }<br />
            }<br />
            else<br />
            {<br />
                Debug.WriteLine(&quot;unexpected status code: &quot; + response.StatusCode);<br />
            }<br />
        }</p>
<p>        this.InternalConnectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Disconnected;<br />
    }<br />
    catch (Exception ex)<br />
    {<br />
        Debug.WriteLine(ex);<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]</p>
<p>In the <code>ReadResponseStream</code> method we continually read the stream until we are interrupted by the user setting the connection status to a value other than <code>ConnectionStatus.Connected</code>, by calling the <code>Disconnect()</code> method, or an exception is thrown whilst reading from the <code>stream</code>. For each read from the stream we parse the data to get the tweets from the real-time data feed in <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> format.</p>
<p>[csharp]<br />
/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />
/// Reads the information received from the Twitter real-time data stream.<br />

private void ReadResponseStream(HttpWebRequest request, HttpWebResponse response)<br />
{<br />
    byte[] buffer = new byte[65536];<br />
    using (Stream stream = response.GetResponseStream())<br />
    {<br />
        while (this.InternalConnectionStatus == ConnectionStatus.Connected)<br />
        {<br />
            int read = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);<br />
            UTF8Encoding encoding = new UTF8Encoding();<br />
            string data = encoding.GetString(buffer, 0, read);<br />
            ParseResponseChunk(data);<br />

<p>        // need to call request.Abort or the the thread will block at the end of<br />
        // the using block.<br />
        request.Abort();<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
The <code>ParseResponseChunk</code> checks the data it's passed and ensures that the data contains at least one full status message (tweet). I'll not go into the details of that here since it's just a matter of string parsing.</p>
<p><small>I chose to use the JSON format simply because the content passed over the wire is smaller than the XML feed. This should mean that the application has to do less work to read all the data. What we really should also do is benchmark the deserialisation of JSON against the deserialisation of XML to see which performs best within a Silverlight application.<br />

<p>A single Tweet, or in TweetStreamer a <code>StatusMessage</code>, can be deserialised using an instance of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.json.datacontractjsonserializer(VS.95).aspx">DataContractJsonSerializer</a>.<br />
[csharp]<br />

        message = ser.ReadObject(stream) as StatusMessage;<br />
    }</p>

    {<br />
        message = null;<br />
        Debug.WriteLine(&quot;message had no ID. Assuming to be a delete message so nulling message object&quot;);<br />
    }</p>

}<br />
[/csharp]</p>
<h3 id="binding-the-data-to-the-grid"><a href="#binding-the-data-to-the-grid">Binding the data to the grid</a></h3>
<p>To bind the data to a DataGrid the grid needs to be defined in XAML. In addition we can specify the properties on the <code>StatusMessage</code> that we want to bind to columns. In the XAML below we are binding the <code>CreatedAtString</code> property to a Time column, a <code>User.ScreenName</code> to a User column, and a <code>Text</code> property to a Message column. Notice the cool binding of <code>User.ScreenName</code>. The <code>StatusMessage.User</code> property returns an instance of another class and we are actually binding to a property on the returned class.<br />
[xml]<br />
&lt;data:DataGrid Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; x:Name=&quot;Tweets&quot; AutoGenerateColumns=&quot;False&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;data:DataGrid.Columns&gt;<br />
        &lt;data:DataGridTextColumn Header=&quot;Time&quot;<br />
            Binding=&quot;{Binding CreatedAtString}&quot; /&gt;<br />
        &lt;data:DataGridTextColumn Header=&quot;User&quot;<br />
            Binding=&quot;{Binding User.ScreenName}&quot; /&gt;<br />
        &lt;data:DataGridTextColumn Header=&quot;Message&quot;<br />
            Binding=&quot;{Binding Text}&quot; /&gt;<br />
    &lt;/data:DataGrid.Columns&gt;<br />
&lt;/data:DataGrid&gt;<br />
[/xml]<br />
Next, the code to set up the binding and registering for <code>StatusMessage</code> updates using the <code> StatusMessageReceived</code> event. As you many have noticed, the <code>StatusMessage</code> object implements the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged(VS.95).aspx">INotifyPropertyChanged</a> interface. This was used so that we could add each <code>StatusMessage</code> to an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604(VS.95).aspx">ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</a> and then bind it to a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.datagrid(VS.95).aspx">DataGrid</a> to display the Tweets in real-time.<br />
[csharp]<br />
Connection _twitterConnection;<br />
ObservableCollection&lt;IStatusMessage&gt; _messages = new ObservableCollection&lt;IStatusMessage&gt;();<br />
public MainPage()<br />
{<br />
    InitializeComponent();</p>
<p>    Tweets.ItemsSource = _messages;</p>
<p>    _twitterConnection = new Connection();<br />
    _twitterConnection.StatusMessageReceived += new Connection.OnStatusMessageReceivedEventHandler<br />
        (twitterConnection_StatusMessageReceived);<br />
    _twitterConnection.Connect();<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
Finally, whenever we get a <code>StatusMessageReceived</code> callback we need to add the new <code>StatusMessage</code> to the <code>ObservableCollection<T>&lt;/code&gt; collection. <em>This has to be done on the UI thread and via the <code>Tweets.ItemsSource</code> property or the UI will not update.</em><br />
[csharp]<br />
/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />
/// Status message received event handler.<br />
/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />
/// &lt;param name=&quot;sender&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
/// &lt;param name=&quot;args&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
void twitterConnection_StatusMessageReceived(object sender, IStatusMessageReceivedEventArgs args)<br />
{<br />
    Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(() =&gt;<br />
        AddMessage(args.Message)<br />
    );<br />
}&lt;/p&gt;
<p>/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />
/// Adds a message to the observable message list which updates the UI.<br />
/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />
/// &lt;param name=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
void AddMessage(IStatusMessage message)<br />
{<br />
    ObservableCollection&lt;IStatusMessage&gt; messageList = ((ObservableCollection&lt;IStatusMessage&gt;)Tweets.ItemsSource);<br />
    messageList.Insert(0, message);<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
Hopefully this will have helped you understand how the Twitter real-time data stream is consumed and an example of how you can use it within a <strong>Real-Time Rich Internet Application</strong>. Now, why now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tweetstreamer/">download the TweetStreamer library and example application</a> and have a play.</p>
<div class="information"><strong>Limitations</strong>: Although I've seen the sample application perform reasonably well I've also seen it perform quite poorly. How well it performs will depend on the machine running the application and the frequency of the updates from the real-time Twitter stream. In later posts I'll provide information on how to improve performance by making changes to the client code and I'll also go into what can be done on the server.</div>
<h3 id="download"><a href="#download">Download</a></h3>

<p>This screencast was supposed to be short but ended up being just shy of 10 minutes. In it I provide some technical detail of how I built the application, show the basics of how Fiddler is used to give access to the Twitter real-time data stream, and give a demo of the application.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are trying to make a web request from a Silverlight application the first thing the Silverlight runtime will do is request a security policy file (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645032(VS.95).aspx">Network Security Access Restrictions in Silverlight</a>) from the root of the server you are making your web request to. This happens if you are making your request using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest(VS.95).aspx">HttpWebRequest</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient(VS.95).aspx">WebClient</a> class. If the Silverlight runtime fails to get a security policy file your web request will fail. If your Silverlight application relies on this web request then you are going to need to contact the server owner and get them to add a security file but until then you can use the <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler HTTP Proxy</a> to trick the Silverlight runtime into believing that it does have permission to make the request.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-425"></a><br />
<small>If you want to skip the explanation you can jump <a href="#screencast">straight to the screencast</a></small></p>
<h2 id="how-silverlight-makes-a-web-request"><a href="#how-silverlight-makes-a-web-request">How Silverlight makes a web request</a></h2>
<p>If you were making a web request from Silverlight to download the following page:</p>
<p><code>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/10/23/how-i-approach-problem-solving-in-code.html</code></p>
<p>The Silverlight runtime would first request</p>
<p><code>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/clientaccesspolicy.xml</code></p>
<p>If this request fails it will then request</p>
<p><code>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/crossdomain.xml</code></p>
<p>If both of these requests fail (return a 404 HTTP status) the Silverlight runtime will not allow you to make your web request. *</p>
<p><small>* Note: The web request failure due to a failure to download a security policy file can manifest itself in a number of ways. I'll try to remember to put a post up about this later.</small></p>
<p>The clientaccesspolicy.xml file is Microsoft's own security policy file. The crossdomain.xml file is used by Adobe Flash but is also supported by Silverlight. For more information see <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ActionScript/3.0_ProgrammingAS3/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b90204-7e08.html#WS366737CC-0BD3-47b4-8292-569FB3AA276B">master-policy file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we've got the background information out of the way we can get on to the interesting stuff.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-using-the-twitter-streaming-feed"><a href="#an-example-using-the-twitter-streaming-feed">An example using the Twitter Streaming Feed</a></h2>
<p>If you wanted to write your own <a href="/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html">Real-Time Rich Internet Application (RTRIA)</a> that consumed data from the <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation">Twitter real-time data stream</a> you'd be stuck. Well, you'll be stuck until Twitter puts a security policy file up **. Until then you can trick the Silverlight runtime by using <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a> to detect the security policy file request and fake a response.</p>
<p><small>**  The following URLs are where Twitter would put their security policy files should they decide to allow cross domain access. Please not that you'll be prompted for your Twitter username and password if you click on them by the browser because you need to sign in with valid twitter credentials to access the twitter <em>stream</em> domain: http://stream.twitter.com/clientaccesspolicy.xml and http://stream.twitter.com/crossdomain.xml)</small></p>
<p>To do this you will need to set up an <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/Fiddler2/help/AutoResponder.asp">AutoResponder</a> in Fiddler that intercepts the request for the security policy file by the Silverlight runtime and returns a fake security policy file. In the example below I have an AutoResponder set up for <code>http://stream.twitter.com/crossdomain.xml</code>.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_426" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Using Fiddler to AutoRespond with a fake Security Policy File"]<a title="Using Fiddler to AutoRespond with a fake Security Policy File " href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/UsingFiddlerToAutoRespondWithAFakeSecurityPolicyFile.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-426 " title="UsingFiddlerToAutoRespondWithAFakeSecurityPolicyFile" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/UsingFiddlerToAutoRespondWithAFakeSecurityPolicyFile-300x195.png" alt="Using Fiddler to AutoRespond with a fake Security Policy File" width="300" height="195" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Here's an example of a crossdomain.xml security policy file which grants access to requests from all domains.</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy
  SYSTEM "http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd"&gt;
&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;
  &lt;allow-access-from domain="*" /&gt;
&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;</pre>
<p>Once you've set up the AutoResponder start Fiddler. Then start your Silverlight application that is trying to stream data from Twitter and bingo! You should have real-time data from Twitter in your RIA - a Real-Time Rich Internet Application (RTRIA).</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/10/29/real-time-rich-internet-applications-rtria.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Real-Time Rich Internet Applications</strong> (<strong>RTRIA</strong>s) are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application">RIA</a>s that consume and display real-time data. They have all the characteristics of an RIA with the added feature that data is being pushed to them in real-time as soon as it becomes available. This is in contrast to the current polling solution employed by most RIAs or other web applications that display updating data.</p>
<p>I mentioned <strong>RTRIA</strong>s for the first time back in April 2009 in a post called "<a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">What is the real-time web</a>" on the Caplin Systems Platformability blog, and since then there has been a real-time web explosion. The "real-time web" is now <strong>the</strong> buzz phrase around the Internet that everybody is jumping on. Back in April I set up a <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alert</a> for the term "real-time web". Back then I got maybe one Google Alert a day for this term, probably less. Now, I get at least two dense emails a day from Google with people using the term for all sorts of things; real-time web stats, real-time analytics, real-time search, <a href="http://rsscloud.org/">rssCloud</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">pubsubhubbub</a>, the list goes on. <em>This is not the real-time web!</em> Whilst some of the things on this list will help  the web become <em>truly real-time</em> (rssCloud and pubsubhubbub may even form the back bone), none of these things give the user a truly real-time web experience.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-456"></a></p>
<p>My opinion about what the real-time web is has not changed from that <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">first blog post</a>. For me, it's not just about <em>data being available</em> as soon as it's been published. In this situation the user still has to actively make a request to see if any data is available. Instead it's about making a single request for data (a <em>subscription</em>) and that data being pushed to your RIA to be consumed by the application user in real-time. Quite a few applications have implemented a polling solution (more on this later) but the experience presented to the user is not <em>truly real-time</em>.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_463" align="alignnone" width="659" caption="&quot;Real-Time?&quot;"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/real-time-web-twitter-search.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-463" title="Twitter &quot;real-time web&quot; search results" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/real-time-web-twitter-search.png" alt="&quot;Real-Time&quot;" width="659" height="429" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>In my opinion the only way to guarantee being able to deliver <em>truly real-time data</em> (<strong>TRTD</strong>) to a web application is by maintaining a streaming connection to the source of the data using a <em>continuous</em> streaming HTTP connection. Most web applications use a technique called polling or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">long polling</a> to retrieve their data which means that although the data is initially "fresh", within seconds it could be out of date, or more information may be available. I'll discuss server technologies further in a later post.</p>
<p>At the moment there are a number of technologies that allow you to develop RTRIAs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">Ajax</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/SILVERLIGHT/overview/default.aspx">Silverlight</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/">Flash</a> are the three mainstream solutions. The core barriers to RTRIAs are the scalability of server technology and access to truly real-time data.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/10/23/how-i-approach-problem-solving-in-code.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was posed the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Write a piece of code that prints all odd integer numbers between 1 and 99</p></blockquote>
<p>This really isn't a difficult question but it still requires some thought. When I'm posed with any question I like to break things down into their constituent parts.</p>
<p>Here's the process I went through:</p>
<p>Okay, so I'll define two variables for a start and end value and there's going to have to be a loop.<br />
[csharp]int startValue = 1;<br />
int endValue = 99;<br />
for(int i = startValue;<br />
     i &amp;lt;= endValue;<br />
     i++)<br />
{<br />
   // work out if &quot;i&quot; is an odd number<br />
}[/csharp]<br />
Now, for the odd number detection. And... after a few umms and errrs ... I'm going to have to mod 2 (<code>%2</code>) the current value of <code>i</code> to work out if the value is odd. More ... umms and errs. Okay, I've finally worked out that if something mod 2 is not equal to 0 it's clearly an odd number. This took me longer than it should have but never mind. Once I've detected if <code>i</code> is an odd number I'll then put the odd number into a list for use later.<br />
[csharp]<br />
int startValue = 1;<br />
int endValue = 99;<br />
IList&lt;int&gt; oddValues = new List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;();<br />
for(int i = startValue;<br />
     i &amp;lt;= endValue;<br />
     i++)<br />
{<br />
   if(i%2 != 0)<br />
   {<br />
      oddValues.Add(i);<br />
   }<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
Those of you that are good at these little puzzles, or just think this is way too easy, might already be screaming at me about one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are you using a <code>IList<int>&lt;/code&gt;, why don't you just print the value?&lt;/li&gt;
<li>Odd numbers are always 2 apart so why aren't you just increment <code>i</code> by 2 using <code>i+=2</code>?</li>
&lt;/ul&gt;
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-382"></a><br />
I admit it,  I missed the second point and that is a bit silly of me. However, what I have starting doing is <a title="separation of concerns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separating the concerns</a> of the piece of code. The code does two things; it detects the odd number and it prints the odd numbers. Those are two very distinct things. So, my code now looks like this:<br />
[csharp]<br />
int startValue = 1;<br />
int endValue = 99;<br />
IList&lt;int&gt; oddNumbers = new List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;();<br />
for(int i = startValue;<br />
     i &amp;lt;= endValue;<br />
     i++)<br />
{<br />
   if(i%2 != 0)<br />
   {<br />
      oddNumbers.Add(i);<br />
   }<br />
}</p>
<p>string oddNumbersList = string.Join(&quot;,&quot;, oddNumbers.ToArray());<br />
Console.WriteLine(oddNumbersList );<br />
[/csharp]<br />
I'm now going to refactor this further so I'll put the two different pieces of functionality into different methods. I'll rename the <code>i</code>, <code>startValue</code> and <code>endValue</code> variables to be something a bit more useful; say <code>numberToCheck</code>, <code>startNumber</code> and <code>endNumber</code>. I'll also create another helper for the odd number checking named <code>IsOddNumber</code>:<br />
[csharp]<br />
IList&lt;int&gt; GetOddNumbersBetween(int startNumber, int endNumber)<br />
{<br />
   IList oddValues = new List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;();<br />
   for(int numberToCheck = startNumber;<br />
        numberToCheck &amp;lt;= endNumber;<br />
        numberToCheck++)<br />
   {<br />
      if(IsOddNumber(numberToCheck) == true)<br />
      {<br />
         oddValues.Add(numberToChecki);<br />
      }<br />
   }<br />
   return oddValues;<br />
}</p>
<p>bool IsOddNumber(int number)<br />
{<br />
   return (number % 2 == 1);<br />
}</p>
<p>void PrintOddNumbersBetween(int startNumber, int endNumber)<br />
{<br />
   IList&lt;int&gt; oddNumbers = GetOddNumbersBetween(startNumber, endNumber);<br />
   string oddNumbersList = string.Join(&quot;,&quot;, oddNumbers.ToArray());<br />
   Console.WriteLine(oddNumbersList);<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
Let's say I then notice the second point you've been screaming at me about (Odd numbers are always 2 apart so why aren't you just increment i by 2 using i+=2) that I mentioned above? In practice I should notice this sort of thing either when I give the code a complete review, or one of my peers spots it. When I see this problem I decide to update the <code>for</code> loop, as noted, and I then see that I possibly don't need the <code>if(IsOddNumber(i) == true)</code> statement. Although it would pain me to do this, since it's a lovely little method, I would need to consider deleting it. But then it strikes me, I'm no longer just solving the "odd numbers between 1 and 99 problem" so I can't just assume that the <code>startNumber</code> is going to be an odd number. I need to make sure that it's an odd number so I'll create another small utility method for that called <code>EnsureOddNumber</code> which will check if the value passed is an odd number, and if not return the next odd number (I'd like to rethink the name of this method).</p>
<p>[csharp]<br />
IList&lt;int&gt; GetOddNumbersBetween(int startNumber, int endNumber)<br />
{<br />
   startNumber = EnsureOddNumber(startNumber);</p>
<p>   IList&lt;int&gt; oddValues = new List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;();<br />
   for(int numberToCheck = startNumber;<br />
        numberToCheck &amp;lt;= endNumber;<br />
        numberToCheck+=2)<br />
   {<br />
      oddValues.Add(numberToCheck);<br />
   }<br />
   return oddValues;<br />
}</p>
<p>int EnsureOddNumber(int number)<br />
{<br />
   if( IsOddNumber(startNumber) == false )<br />
   {<br />
      startNumber++;<br />
   }<br />
   return startNumber;<br />
}</p>
<p>bool IsOddNumber(int number)<br />
{<br />
   return (number % 2 == 1);<br />
}</p>
<p>void PrintOddNumbersBetween(int startNumber, int endNumber)<br />
{<br />
   IList&lt;int&gt; oddNumbers = GetOddNumbersBetween(startNumber, endNumber);<br />
   string oddNumbersList = string.Join(&quot;,&quot;, oddNumbers.ToArray());<br />
   Console.WriteLine(oddNumbersList);<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]</p>
<p>Now, when I look at this code I get a warm feeling because I feel that it solves the problem, it's well engineered, the concerns are separated and the code is completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting">self documenting</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few comments that people may have here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The question asked specifically to print odd values between 1 and 99 and you've done more than was required.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although my answer does satisfy the original question have I over engineered things? The question does specifically ask us to print odd values between 1 and 99 so maybe I should have created a function that just satisfied that requirement.</p>
<p>[csharp]<br />
void PrintOddNumbersBetween1And99()<br />
{<br />
   for(int i = 1;<br />
        i &amp;lt;= 99;<br />
        i+=2)<br />
   {<br />
      Console.WriteLine(i + &quot; &quot;);<br />
   }<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]</p>
<p>And I'd have to admit that this very short piece of code exactly answers the question. But I'd also argue that there is very little chance of this code being reused. Don't get me wrong, you definitely shouldn't over engineer things but there should be some scope for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse">code reuse</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>For such a simple problem you've over engineered this.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a better solutions that that... it's not efficient</p></blockquote>
<p>Is creating four methods over engieering? Does my code require any comments to provide documentation? There may well be a more performant solution to this, but that's not my point. My point is the way of approaching a question: the thought processes involved in understanding the problem and breaking it down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separate concerns</a>, making it easy to read, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse">reusable</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting">self documenting</a>. If the code that worked out the odd numbers is not efficient it could easily be changed in one place without impacting the interface, the other methods within the class, or the overall functionality.</p>
<p>Some people may jump to the simplest solution but I think the way i've described approaching and solving the problem demonstrates good practice. If I'm completely honest I would normally approach the development of something such as this by writing a test case first since I practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> but that can wait for another blog post.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've recently created an application called <a href="http://getgravatar.com">GetGravatar</a> that allows you to update your Twitter profile picture with your Gravatar. Once I'd set up my <a href="http://blog.smarx.com/posts/custom-domain-names-in-windows-azure">Windows Azure custom domain name</a> I decided I wanted the web address for this new service site to be without "www" as seems to be all the rage (to keep the web address short). So, I looked at doing a Response.Redirect to catch any attempts to access my domain with "www" in it. I'm very sure that there are better ways of doing this but I added the following to my Site.master file:</p>
<pre name="code" class="csharp">
    if (Request.Url.ToString().StartsWith("http://www."))
    {
        Response.StatusCode = (int)System.Net.HttpStatusCode.MovedPermanently;
        string responseUrl = Request.Url.ToString().Replace("http://www.", "http://");
        Response.Redirect(responseUrl, true);
    }
</pre>
<p>So, if somebody types in http://www.getgravatar.com (see it works) or anything with a "www." in the URL they will be redirected to a non-www page. However, the redirect seemed to go to the correct URL but with port 20000. I've no idea why this is so I had to add a special case in to remove the port.</p>
<pre name="code" class="csharp">
    if (Request.Url.ToString().StartsWith("http://www."))
    {
        Response.StatusCode = (int)System.Net.HttpStatusCode.MovedPermanently;
        string responseUrl = Request.Url.ToString().Replace("http://www.", "http://");
        responseUrl = responseUrl.Replace(":20000", "");
        Response.Redirect(responseUrl, true);
    }
</pre>
<p>I've not read up to see if this is expected but I thought it was quite unexpected and may be of use to somebody else in the future.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/08/28/windows-azure-503-service-unavailable.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/08/28/windows-azure-503-service-unavailable.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I finally got around to trying out ASP.NET MVC and while I was at it I thought I'd also give Windows Azure a whirl. Windows Azure doesn't support ASP.NET MVC out of the box but Jim over on MSDN Blogs has written up the details of how to get <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jnak/archive/2008/10/28/asp-net-mvc-projects-running-on-windows-azure.aspx">ASP.Net MVC Projects running on Windows Azure</a>.</p>
<h3 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h3>
<p>So, I followed the instruction from the blog and uploaded the package and configuration file, waited for the staging application to get into a runnable state, and clicked on the staging link...</p>
<blockquote><p>Windows Azure - 503 Service Unavailable</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly not a good thing! In addition to this error I occasionally got a random network error or a full-on connection error reported by the browser.</p>
<p>I tried googling for this error but there was nothing about this problem after deploying to the real Windows Azure hosting (the cloud). As far as I can tell there's no way of getting any debug information or logs to work out what's going wrong. Maybe this is something that Microsoft will add later on?</p>
<h3 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h3>
<p>Then it struck me that I hadn't actually set up any kind of TableStorage on my Windows Azure hosting so I removed all mentions of storage and database connections from the MVC application. This included editing Web.config and removing the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &lt;section name="authenticationService" type="System.Web.Configuration.ScriptingAuthenticationServiceSection, System.Web.Extensions, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31BF3856AD364E35" requirePermission="false" allowDefinition="MachineToApplication" /&gt; section element.</li>
<li>The &lt;connectionStrings&gt; element</li>
<li>The &lt;membership&gt;element</li>
<li>The &lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt; element</li>
<li>The &lt;profile&gt; element</li>
<li>The &lt;roleManager&gt;element</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Update: I've found that without the &lt;authentication&gt;element I started getting the error below so you may want to instead replace it with :</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>CCT: Role instances did not start within the time allowed.  Please try again.  If you continue to encounter this behavior please try shutting down the Development Fabric.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm guessing that not all of these elements actually need to be removed but doing so resulted in the MVC ASP.NET application working in Windows Azure.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update 2: ServiceDefinition.csdef</em></strong></p>
<p>If you happen to get network timeouts or 404 network connection issues it's worth checking your ServiceDefinition.csdef to make sure that you've got port 80 configured. I noticed that mine had updated to port 8080 so obviously I couldn't access the staging site on port 80 like I was trying. If you do have the port set to something else other than port 80 you can use that port to access your application but the ServiceDefinition.csdef does have a comment in there telling you your application should be on port 80 so you are probably best to stick with that.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;!-- Must use port 80 for http and port 443 for https when running in the cloud --&gt;<br />
&lt;InputEndpoint name="HttpIn" protocol="http" port="80" /&gt;</p></blockquote>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/08/05/book-review-juggle-rethink-work-reclaim-your-life.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Many times in the past I've said or heard the term "work life balance". In job interviews, in chats with my line managers and work colleagues, or in conversation with friends and family. It tends to be used when anybody is talking about finding <em>time</em> for family, friends, entertainment and enjoyment outside of work. It also suggests that there is a dividing line between work and life that can be easily drawn and stepped over. Finally it suggests that we want that separation between work and life and that work doesn't fit into life; that it can't, and potentially shouldn't, be integrated.</p>
<p>For some people this statement holds true. They don't want to do or think about work outside of their 9:00 to 5:30 job. There is a definite line to be drawn. For other people, such as <a href="http://www.iansanders.com/">Ian Sanders</a>, work is enjoyable because he's working on things he's passionate about. Ian integrates work and life because he enjoys what he does and understands the benefits it provides. Many other people feel the same way and Ian interviews a select few in his book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1906465371?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1906465371"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VtHrQuWBL._SL160_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=philleggsoftc-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=1906465371" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p>In "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1906465371?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1906465371">Juggle! Rethink work, reclaim your life</a>" Ian discusses the motivations behind his choice to live in the "scrambled up world of work" where he integrates work and life. He provides hints and tips on how he, and others including <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> (a personal favourite of mine), manage to "live the juggle life" and the benefits that this provides. Being a juggler certainly isn't all plain sailing and the book also covers valuable information on the challanges and extra responsibilities that you may face if you make take the plunge.</p>
<p>Ian's first book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1841127981?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dorotcottr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1841127981">LEAP!: Ditch Your Job, Start Your Own Business &amp; Set Yourself Free</a>", introduced some similar concepts to those covered in Juggle!. I actually read Juggle! before I read LEAP! and there is some crossover, but not enough to take anything away from either book. Juggle!, in contrast to the title of Ian's first book, even suggests you should consider staying with your current employer and suggests way of negotiating or fashioning a role and a lifestyle that suits you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1906465371?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1906465371">Juggle! Rethink work, reclaim your life</a> contains 198 pages packed with thought provoking content and discussion. The book is very accessible and contains short, informative and well structured sections and chapters. So much so I would almost class the book as a reference and I'll certainly be going back again to read through the a number of chapters or work my way though some of the great lists that Ian has compiled in the near future.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A while ago a wrote a blog article called <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">What is the real-time Web?</a>. At this time (19/04/2009) even Wikipedia did not have a definition for what "real-time web" was. It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">does now</a>.</p>
<p>The definition is short and sweet:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web"><p>Real-time web is the concept of searching for and finding information online as it is produced. Advancements in web search technology coupled with growing use of social media enable online activities to be queried as they occur.</p>
<p>A traditional web search crawls and indexes web pages periodically, returning results based on relevance to the search query. The real time web delivers the most popular topics recently discussed or posted by users. The content is often "soft" in that it is based on the social web - people's opinions, attitudes, thoughts and interests - as opposed to hard news or facts.</p></blockquote>
<p>At present there is no mention of the technology behind the real-time web. Nothing about Twitter and FriendFeed helping to form the definition.</p>
<p>Do you agree with this definition? What web 2.0 platforms do you think have helped define what "real-time web" is? What technologies do you believe have pushed the "real-time web" into such prominence?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>My girlfriend was out at the Take That concert at Wembley so I was left on my own this Saturday afternoon. Not knowing what to do with myself as the evening approached I decided to go for a run. Normally I find running quite difficult. As I run my mind tends to concentrate on my breathing which puts me off the run. The difference today was that I went exploring.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-236"></a></p>
<p>I commute in to London most days from Hertford East. Over the past few weeks taking the train journey has been quite painful for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the heat on the train is really uncomfortable and secondly because the train goes through a beautifully scenic area between Hertford and Ware called Kings Mead which makes you wish were out walking through the nature reserve rather than in a hot stuffy carriage.</p>
<p>So, tonight I went for a run around Kings Mead and really enjoyed it. I took a couple of <a href="#qik-videos">Qik videos</a>, some <a href="#st-leonards-church-hertford">photos of St. Leonards Church</a> which was en-route, and I've even created <a href="#run-around-hertford-map">a map of my run</a>.</p>
<p><a name="qik-videos"></a></p>
<h2 id="43-feet-stone"><a href="#43-feet-stone">43 Feet Stone</a></h2>
<p>The stone that is shown right at the start of the video says "43 Feet" on it. It did have some other writing on it but I couldn't get close enough to read it. The other interesting point in this video is the penalty of FIVE POUNDS for violating any of the rules on the sign. The sign could maybe do with being updated.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/07/01/microsoft-bing-com-round-table-thoughts.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I blogged that I was going to attend a <a href="/2009/06/27/bing-com-round-table.html">Microsoft bing round table</a>. I've now attended and here are the key points and interesting facts that I took from the event. You can also <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23meetbing">search for #meetbing</a> on twitter for relevant tweets.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-225"></a><br />
[nggallery id=4]</p>
<h2 id="bing.com-is-a-re-brand-of-live-search"><a href="#bing.com-is-a-re-brand-of-live-search">Bing.com is a re-brand of Live Search</a></h2>
<p>And Microsoft openly admitted this. Basically Live Search wasn't getting any traction so Microsoft had to do something (<strong>see my next point</strong>).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2391452758"><p>"Microsoft believe they will provide as relevant search results as Google in the UK in a number of months #meetbing" <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2391452758">@leggetter</a></p></blockquote>
<p>What they've done is go with a "web 2.0 name" of "Bing" to try and jazz things up a little. They've also gone back to basics and want to concentrate on the quality and relevance of search results and believe they will <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2391452758">provide as relevant results as Google in a few months</a> and are judging the quality of their <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2391504912">results on something called NDCG</a>. I certainly didn't use Live Search because I found the results pretty useless. Bing definitely returns better results than Live did. An example on this focus on quality is that Bing has only presently <a href="http://twitter.com/Philbradley/statuses/2391299045">indexed around 10 Billion pages</a> which in the scheme of things isn't very much.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/karenblakeman/statuses/2391169015"><p>"Only 1 in 4 searches deliver a successful result. Data from MSN search, tool bar in IE. Could be searching Google, yahoo etc." <a>@karenblakeman</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft also believe they've improved the UX a bit to allow users to refine their search results with the <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2391818464">introduction of the quick tabs/suggested links</a> in a menu on the left hand side of the user interface. They've done this because they believe that <a href="http://twitter.com/karenblakeman/statuses/2391169015">only 1 in 4 searches deliver a successful result</a> so this allows users to more easily find things faster.</p>
<p>Microsoft seem to think the re-branding and basic search tweaks have worked as they showed us data that they believe proves Bing has overtaken Yahoo! as No.2 in the search market. Their source of data to determine where users were going to perform their web search was quite interesting. Their source was the MSN toolbar which is only available to those with Internet Explorer. I guess since IE still has a large share of the market (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">W3Schools Stats</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">Wikipedia Stats</a>) that the figures are more or less correct but some people at the event did question this as a suitable source.</p>
<p>The other thing that Microsoft are doing is to integrate Bing as a "search brand" into all their products in the same way that Google integrate Google search into Gmail, Google Docs etc. So, you will now see "Bing" used to power Hotmail search and most probably all other Microsoft sites or web applications over time.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-tried-to-buy-yahoo!-to-become-no.2-in-search"><a href="#microsoft-tried-to-buy-yahoo!-to-become-no.2-in-search">Microsoft tried to buy Yahoo! to become No.2 in search</a></h2>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2392182540"><p>"Microsoft tried to buy Yahoo to become No.2 in search. Fact admitted here" <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2392182540">@leggetter</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This may not be a big surprise to some people but I didn't know that this was <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2392182540">Microsoft's main motivation to buy Yahoo!</a> and I did read a few articles about the attempted purchase. Microsoft admitted that Yahoo! had the No.2 slot and if they bought them they would gain this position in addition to a well-known brand. They also admitted that they may have kept the Yahoo! brand for their search and ditched Live altogether.</p>
<h2 id="bing-uk-is-in-beta.-bing-us-is-not"><a href="#bing-uk-is-in-beta.-bing-us-is-not">Bing UK is in Beta. Bing US is not</a></h2>
<p>Bing UK is lacking a lot of the functionality of <a href="http://www.bing.com/?scope=web&amp;setmkt=en-US&amp;setlang=SET_NULL&amp;uid=EAC0349C&amp;FORM=W5WA">Bing US</a> since it's still in beta. Microsoft wanted to launch Bing and felt it was better to do it world wide so stuck with the beta. Bing UK will <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2391287460">move out of Beta</a> when more of the functionality you can see in the US is available in the UK.</p>
<h2 id="only-the-standard-verticals-are-being-targeted"><a href="#only-the-standard-verticals-are-being-targeted">Only the standard verticals are being targeted</a></h2>
<p>Local, travel, maps, videos, shopping and news will be the <a href="http://twitter.com/leggetter/statuses/2392611319">verticals that Microsoft initially target</a>. This is a little disappointing as it would be great to see Microsoft break the mould and do something innovative. The only unique vertical that was mentioned is that a music search function is being worked on by the Bing China team.</p>
<p>All in all I thought it was a worthwhile exercise by Microsoft to tell people what they are doing and gather a number of opinions. The consensus of the people at the event is that Bing is going to have to something different to take a significant portion of people away from Google and their current offering doesn't offer too much to do this.</p>
<p>I'm simply happy that Microsoft have upped their game and will at least have Google looking over their shoulders albiet way back into the distance. Hopefully this competition will provoke innovation in search that has been generally stagnent for the past few years up until the introduction of the real-time web. Maybe this could be something that Microsoft could excel at?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Monday between 19:00 and 21:00 I'm going to a <a title="Bing.com" href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> roundtable (round table) in London. The event is being organise by Colin Mercer and is described as:</p>

<ul>
<li>How Bing are pushing use of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd251056.aspx">Bing API</a> and <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/">Bing developer centre</a>.</li>
<li>What are they doing to ensure information is available to the <em>real-time web</em> as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions that you'd like asked and I'll do my best to ask them. You can do this in a number of ways. During the event the hashtag in use will be <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23meetbing">#meetbing</a></strong>. Prior to the event I'd suggest people maybe use <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23askbing">#askbing</a></strong>. Failing that you can contact me directly or leave a comment on this blog post.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[The O2 Mobile Phone Upgrade saga concludes]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/06/01/the-o2-mobile-phone-upgrade-saga-concludes.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/06/01/the-o2-mobile-phone-upgrade-saga-concludes.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I finally managed to get the O2 XDA Serra (HTC Touch Pro) but boy was it a hassle! (See <a href="/2009/05/07/trying-to-upgrade-my-o2-mobile.html">Trying to upgrade my O2 mobile phone</a>) I had to start a new contract with O2 and lose my old one that I'd had since 2004. I now know that this means I've lost 5 years of loyalty bonus points (or similar). I only found this out when I tried to get my PAC for my old O2 contract and the "retention team" offered me 18 months free with 250 text messages and 75 minutes. Yes, FREE.</p>
<p>Other problems along the way were:</p>
<ul>
<li>"You can't take an existing simplicity tariff number onto a new O2 online tariff"</li>
<li>Paying for two contracts for a number of days whilst O2 muddle along</li>
<li>O2 actually trying to get me to keep two mobile contracts. Why would I want two mobile phone contracts? I can only use one phone at a time!</li>
<li>Plenty of mis-communication</li>
<li>Numerous calls to and from O2 Customer Services</li>
<li>No offer of a "sweetener" to say sorry although they did end up manually transferring my phone number after I threatened to cancel both contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p>When my 24 month contract is up I will do everything in my power to use an alternative mobile phone network.</p>
<p>I now have my O2 XDA Serra (HTC Touch Pro) and I'm very happy with it.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-should-have-done"><a href="#what-i-should-have-done">What I should have done</a></h2>
<p>I should have phoned up and tried to cancel my contract as soon as I was displeased with the service. I then would have been put straight through to the "retention team" at O2 who would have done everything within their power to keep me. This most probably would have included getting the XDA Serra (HTC Touch Pro) for a discounted price and getting a better general tarriff. You live and learn.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/05/07/trying-to-upgrade-my-o2-mobile.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been out of contract with O2 for probably around two years now and during this time I’ve been perfectly happy with the XDA IQ that I’ve got. I also carry around a <a type="amzn" category="electronics &amp; photo">Blackberry</a> that I have for work so use that to browse the Internet, check email, and send tweets. I’ve not also got a <a type="amzn" category="electronics &amp; photo">3G USB dongle</a> from work that I can use on the train. All these gadgets have become a bit of a burden and I’ve been considering upgrading my phone to something that I can use as a 3G modem for my laptop, has a reasonable mobile browser, GPS, and has a good set of other applications for it such as Google Maps, a Twitter client, and a Yammer client. I want to replace three gadgets with one.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking at the <a type="amzn" category="electronics &amp; photo">HTC phones</a> for quite a while since they run windows (I like Microsoft stuff), I can easily sync my contacts and calendar (ActiveSync is still the best for this), I can write .NET compact framework applications for it (I’ve already said I like Microsoft stuff), and <a type="amzn" category="electronics &amp; photo">HTC</a> are generally up there as one of the best phone/PDA manufacturers.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_171" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="HTC Touch Pro"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-171" title="htctouchpro" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/htctouchpro-300x206.png" alt="htctouchpro" width="300" height="206" />[/caption]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, I was delighted when I recently went to the O2 website to see that they have the XDA Serra which is actually the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001E7TN60?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B001E7TN60">HTC Touch Pro</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=philleggsoftc-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B001E7TN60" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. The HTC Touch Pro HD and<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0021L95G6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=philleggsoftc-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B0021L95G6">HTC Touch Pro II</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=philleggsoftc-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B0021L95G6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> are available but I would have needed to fork out for the whole phone myself. I’m an existing customer so I went straight to the Upgrades section of the website, requested my upgrade code, chose the Online 20 tariff, and looked for the Web Bolt-on to give me unlimited* data on my phone. The Web Bolt-on isn’t available.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_176" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="O2 Upgrade Page"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/o2upgrade.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-176" title="O2 Upgrade Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/o2upgrade-300x169.png" alt="o2upgrade1" width="300" height="169" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>From here I decided to find out if I would get this option I were a new O2 customer. I found out that not only can a new customer add the Web bolt-on but also they get the O2 XDA Serra around £50 cheaper than an existing customer. So, I decided to phone up a “online upgrades advisor” (0800 1313136) to see if they could help me order by phone with the Web bolt-on and at the same price as a new customer would pay. The “online upgrades advisor” was of very little. I was informed that they “don’t have the phone on the system” so the only way to get it was to upgrade online (for a more expensive price and without the Web bolt-on) – No thanks!</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_175" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="O2 New Customer Page"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/o2newsales.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-175" title="O2 New Customer Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/o2newsales-300x261.png" alt="O2 New Sales Page" width="300" height="261" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>After phone calls to O2’s main number as an existing customer (08442 020202) and customer services, and Hertford’s O2 shop I had to phone new sales. They informed me that since I was on the rolling Simplicity deal I would be treated as a new customer anyway. So, I had to set up a new contract, do a credit check, set up a new O2 account, and set up a new direct debit. I also now have to cancel my existing simplicity one when I get my new phone. In addition, if I could have done the upgrade one I could have selected where I wanted my new phone to be sent to. Since I've made my purchase of a new contract over the phone I've had to get my new phone delivered to my registered address and I know I won't be in meaning I'll have to drive out to the delivery depot to collect it.</p>
<h2 id="what’s-my-point?"><a href="#what’s-my-point?">What’s my point?</a></h2>
<p>My point is that I wanted to pay £200 for a new phone and sign up for a 24 month contract worth a good few quid and nobody at O2 seemed too bothered to help me out. Also, I can't believe that O2 force you to get your phone delivered to your registered address. Most people don't work from home so won't be there to receive the delivery. How much customer and delivery driver time must this waste?!</p>
<p>I’m sticking with O2 at the moment simply because they offer the best coverage for where I live. When this contract is up I’ll probably have moved so I’ll certainly consider another mobile provider above O2.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>About a week ago I wrote a blog article at work entitled "<a href="http://blog.caplin.com/2009/04/20/what-is-the-real-time-web/">What is the real-time web?</a>".

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="&lt;strong&gt;are-we-really-seeing-the-real-time-web?&lt;/strong&gt;"><a href="#&lt;strong&gt;are-we-really-seeing-the-real-time-web?&lt;/strong&gt;"><strong>Are we really seeing the real-time web?</strong></a></h2>
<p>The phrase &#8220;<em>real-time web</em>&#8221; has been streaming its way around the Internet for a while now. It&#8217;s presently being used to describe information being available in search results as soon as it has been published by its author. Examples of this are Twitter or FriendFeed search.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m aware it was Robert Scoble who made this phrase mainstream. Here&#8217;s an example from the start of February, but by this time Robert had been using the term for a while and a quick Google finds the <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWFkd3JpdGV3ZWIuY29tL2FyY2hpdmVzL2dvb2dsZV9maW5hbmNlX2FuZF90aGVfcmVhbF90aW1lX3dlYi5waHA=">term used</a> as early as June 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s do a search for anyone who has written about the Canon 5D MK II but lets constrain that to posts that have at least one like and at least four comments. <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2ZyaWVuZGZlZWQuY29tL3NlYXJjaD9xPUNhbm9uKzVEK01LK0lJJmFtcDtpbnRpdGxlPSZhbXA7aW5jb21tZW50PSZhbXA7c2VydmljZT0mYW1wO2Zyb209JmFtcDtyb29tPSZhbXA7Y29tbWVudD0mYW1wO2xpa2U9JmFtcDtjb21tZW50cz00JmFtcDtsaWtlcz0x">Here&#8217;s the search</a>. Note that the post I wrote just one minute ago is already in the results page. This is the real-time web. &#8211; Robert Scoble (<a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3Njb2JsZWl6ZXIuY29tLzIwMDkvMDIvMDkvaXMtdGhlLXJlYWwtdGltZS13ZWItYS10aHJlYXQtdG8tZ29vZ2xlLXNlYXJjaC8=">http://scobleizer.com/2009/02/09/is-the-real-time-web-a-threat-to-google-search/</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst this is an example of something being almost instantly available from search does it really qualify as being &#8220;real-time&#8221;?</p>
<p><span id="more-89"></span><br />
The first thing to do, as others have done, is understand what the term &#8220;real-time&#8221; means. Rather than going into this I recommend you have a read of the wikipedia definition of <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9SZWFsLXRpbWU=">real-time</a> and watch a Kaazing presentation on <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dzIuc3lzLWNvbi5jb20vd2ViaW5hcmFyY2hpdmUuY2ZtP3NraXA9b24mYW1wO3BpZD13Y19hdzhlX2QyX3M0X3QxX2thYXppbmcmYW1wO3JlZ2lkPTMzOTA0">What is the Real-Time Web</a>. There have been fewer attempts at defining &#8220;real-time web&#8221;. Even Wikipedia presently (19/04/2009) lacks a definition.</p>
<p>For me for something to be real-time web it should meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get up to the second information on a chosen subject.</li>
<li>Make an initial request for information to be delivered across the Internet. Subsequent updates to that information, or information stream, should be delivered as soon as possible without the need to make a additional requests.</li>
<li>Initial information and subsequent updates should be delivered in an acceptable amount of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I go to &lt;a  0="title="Phil" 1="Leggetter" 2="on" 3="Twitter"" href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2xlZ2dldHRlcg=="&gt;my twitter homepage&lt;/a&gt; I don&#8217;t want to have to refresh the page, by clicking the refresh button, or hitting the F5 key, in order to see new messages from the people that I&#8217;m following. Twitter doesn&#8217;t really want users doing this either as it puts load on their server &#8211; but let&#8217;s leave this for another time.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29t"><img title="Twitter" src="http://assets0.twitter.com/images/twitter.png" alt="" width="210" height="49" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Twitter</p>
</div>
<p>This lack of real-time updates on the Twitter site has lead to a surge in Twitter client applications such as <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50d2VldGRlY2suY29tLw==">TweetDeck</a> and <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50d2hpcmwub3JnLw==">Thwirl</a>. These clients simulate real-time by polling the <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2FwaXdpa2kudHdpdHRlci5jb20v">Twitter API</a> at intervals. I&#8217;d like to highlight the word &#8220;<em>simulate</em>&#8221; again and clarify what polling is. What the Twitter client applications are actually doing is making requests to Twitter at periodic intervals to see if the user has had any messages and if they have it displays them, if there are no new messages then it&#8217;s a wasted request.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 290px">
<div style="background-color:black"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-548" title="tweetdeck_logo" src="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/uploads/tweetdeck_logo.png" alt="tweetdeck_logo" width="251" height="50" /></div>
<p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">TweetDeck</p>
&lt;/div&gt;
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 290px"><a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50d2hpcmwub3JnLw=="><img title="Twhirl" src="http://www.twhirl.org/themes/twhirl/logo.jpg" alt="Twhirl" width="220" height="105" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Twhirl</p>
</div>
<p>A much better model would be for Twitter to notify the client that new messages are available by passing the additional messages straight to the Twitter client.</p>
<h2 id="real-time-web-delivery-time"><a href="#real-time-web-delivery-time">Real-time web delivery time</a></h2>
<p>What determines the amount of time that is acceptable between a message being published and it being received by the consumer (user) depends on the context of its use. For something such as instant messaging or a Twitter conversation the time between publication and consumption can be reasonably large, maybe 10 seconds. However, if the publisher is a trading system sending a price and the consumer is a trader 10 seconds is far too long. By the time the price reaches the trader it may be out of date.</p>
<h2 id="real-time-technology"><a href="#real-time-technology">Real-time technology</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3htcHAub3JnLw==">XMPP</a> and <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2NvZGUuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9wL3NpbXBsZXVwZGF0ZXByb3RvY29sLw==">SUP</a> have been touted as the technology to deliver the real-time web but they appear to be server side solutions or require clients with knowledge of the specific technologies. For a web solution people start to turn to Comet server solutions. Caplin Systems &#8211; the real-time web company &#8211; have had the technology available to deliver real-time data for many years now so I wanted to understand why, only now, has the idea of a &#8220;real-time web&#8221; really taken off.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 220px"><img alt="Caplin Systems" src="http://www.caplin.com/assets/templates/caplin/img/logo.gif" title="Caplin Systems" width="210" height="37" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Caplin Systems</p>
</div>
<p>Caplin Systems have a high performance scalable <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXBsaW4uY29tL2NhcGxpbnBsYXRmb3JtLz9jdXJhcnRfaWQ9MzY=">real-time comet server called Liberator</a> that can push updates to subscribing clients as soon as it receives information. The clients are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Java      clients: standalone application or applet</li>
<li>.NET      clients such a windows desktop application or web page embedded      SilverLight widget</li>
<li>JavaScript      clients: any website such as <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tLw==">http://twitter.com</a> or <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2ZyaWVuZGZlZWQuY29tLw==">http://friendfeed.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Twitter and FriendFeed don&#8217;t use Liberator but they could easily do so. All that needs to be done to integrate <em>Real-time Rich Internet Application</em> (<em>RTRIA</em> ?) functionality to an existing web site is include a JavaScript library called <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mcmVlbGliZXJhdG9yLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudGF0aW9uL3NsNGIvaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uLmh0bWw=">SL4B (StreamLink for Browsers)</a>. The <em>RTRIA</em> functionality can then be added to an existing site in the same way that RIA functionality can be introduced to a website using other JavaScript libraries such as <a href="http://blog.caplin.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2pxdWVyeS5jb20v">JQuery</a>. However, in this case the <em>RIA</em> functionality that can be added is a true real-time web experience of data being pushed to the client as soon as it becomes available, without any need for the user to check to see if any new information is available.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>My opinion is that the instant availability of information via search straight after it&#8217;s published doesn&#8217;t really justify the term &#8220;real-time web&#8221;. To be truely real-time the information needs to be pushed to the user. The true real-time web experience and the technology to achieve this is already here but at the moment few people are aware of it and therefore it&#8217;s not in mainstream use. The ideas behind Comet, the Liberator server and Liberator clients provide technology and infrastructure to push data to clients without the need for polling or a user driven information request. Scalability and side by side integration with existing systems are already possible which means there&#8217;s no reason why existing clients such as websites can&#8217;t start taking advantage of it.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I follow <a title="Chris Garrett" href="http://www.chrisg.com/">Chris Garrett</a> on Twitter and he posted a link to a <a title="The worst Transformer" href="http://www.carrentals.co.uk/blog/worst-transformer.html">blog post about Which is the worst Transformer?</a>. As a kid I really liked The Transformers and felt compelled to defend some of them. I posted what is about to follow as a partly tongue-in-cheek comment but it's been "awaiting moderation" for hours so I just thought I'd dump it in my blog. I'm pretty sure that Chris will agree with me about Soundwave as he's got <a title="Chris Garratt's desk" href="http://qik.com/video/965299">the toy on his desk</a>.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-120"></a></p>
<p>I've got to say that I generally disagree with your choices here. The main saving grace is that your choice of No. 1 naff Transformer is probably correct. I know you've got a car thing going on here but some of the Transformers you list were great characters which surely offsets the things that let the toy down.</p>
<p>My main objection is that you are slagging off a lot of the Transformers that were the main characters in the original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/">1986 Transformers the Movie</a> that I think completely rocked!  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">The 2007 version</a> isn't bad but has nowhere near the story or scale of the original move. Give me <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000080/">Orson Welles</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000555/">Judd Nelson</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000559/">Leonard Nimoy</a> and<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919798/"> Frank Welker</a> (plus <a title="Peter Cullen" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191520/">the obvious</a>) any day of the week.

Ok, Blurr is a bit annoying, but isn't that just because the guy doing his voice (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001079/"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Scatman Crothers</span></a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608321/">John Moschitta Jr.</a>) just repeated the same line over and over again. That's not Blurr's fault, it's the fault of the guy who write the script. The toy may have been crap, I don't know. Ok, I'll give you Blurr too.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=1]</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> - the toy does look pretty pants! In the movie he transports the defeated Decepticons back to Cybertron and needs to "jettison weight", whereby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream">Starscream</a> gets rid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron">Megatron</a> and we gain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvatron">Galvatron</a>. So, he has his purpose. I can only assume that the toy was that terrible that for you it justifies the No.8 slot.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundwave_(Transformer)">Soundwave</a> - What planet are you on? Soundwave is a great Transformer. He was there at the very beginning. He is a vital part of a majority of the Transformers stories. And... And.. And he can eject other small Transformers out of his chest. That's Awesome! "Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, Ramjet eject!" The toy wasn't bad either. If I remember correctly you could get small cassette transformers (mentioned in the quote) and put them inside his cassette deck. No, he's not a car but he was a great Transformer. You're just plain wrong with this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodimus">Rodimus Prime</a> - Have you ever seen Transformers the Movie?!? "This is the end of the road Galvatron". He even gets to say Prime's quote of "Autobots, transform and roll out" and it works. He also has a pivotal roll in bringing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime">Optimus Prime</a> back to life in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194172/">The Return of Optimus Prime</a> (brought back to life, eventually, by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessons">Quintesson</a>.....). So, NO, he's not one of the worst Transformers ever (but his toy did look a bit like a mobile home, hmmm).</p>
<p><object width="480" height="295" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/6ByNT12IYbY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6ByNT12IYbY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-Gar">Wreck-Gar</a> - Again, the toy may have been rubbish but that doesn't mean he was one of the worst Transformers ever. He is the leader of the Planet of Junk/the Junkions. As you mentioned, he was voiced by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001385/">Eric Idle</a>, which IS cool. If his arms fall out he can just stick them back in again with some special blue glue (using his legs?). Now that's cool, not crap.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_transformers">Bumblebee</a> A.K.A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbug_(Transformers)">Goldbug</a> - He wants to be friends with people so he's rubbish? What? He's one of the first Transformers and deserves to avoid this list on that fact alone. You just can't put any of the Transformers that were on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_(Transformers)">Ark</a>, which crash landed on earth with Prime, in the list. Period. Oh, and he's a VW Gold...</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_(Transformers)">Jazz</a> - How can anybody say that Jazz is one of the Worst Transformers ever? Jazz wasn't the best in the new movie but they got the character wrong. Jazz has been in Transformers since I can remember and killing him off was just wrong. His toy WAS great. It was one of the first Transformer toys to be made and wasn't all plastic like the more recent ones.  He was on the Ark AND he's a Porsche.</p>
<p>[nggallery id=2]</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> - Firstly his toy was actually pretty cool. He could fire rockets. He was bigger than Prime. His cab was exactly the same as Prime's and Prime was a great toy. He "couldn't take over the leadership when the driving drumstick (Rodimus Prime) was in charge" What? Do you mean that he couldn't open the matrix of leadership after Prime had been killed because it wasn't their "darkest hour"? I got an Ultra Magnus one Christmas and my parents still speak to me, and I've just double-checked, like me. You ain't justifying this one buddy! I think he gets a bad rap - leave him alone.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_144" align="alignnone" width="120" caption="Ultra Magnus - Now, light our darkest hour"]<img class="size-full wp-image-144" title="Ultra Magnus - Now, light our darkest hour" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ultramagnus.gif" alt="Ultra Magnus - Now, light our darkest hour" width="120" height="90" />[/caption]</p>
<p>So, I'll give you Arcee, Blurr and, at a push, Astrotrain. Personally, I'd list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelie_(Transformers)">Wheelie</a> and any of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticons">Insecticons</a>. I'm also surprised that the non-car <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinobots">Dinobots</a> didn't get a mention.</p>
<p>Nice opinion-provoking post.</p>
<p>Til all are one!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jo and I have decided that we are going to start going for Sunday lunch and are going to keep a list of where we've been and what we thought of it. What better place to keep a note of this than on a blog. Here's our first effort at a review.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-107"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=white+horse+hertingfordbury&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;cid=0,0,3718106200407876829&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Location</a><br />
<a href="http://www.whitehorsehotelhertford.com/">Website</a></p>
<p>Hertingfordbury is a village near Hertford. We walked from Hertford to Hertingfordbury along a designated foot and cycling path in around 40 minutes. It's a woodland walk and is a nice way to get your appetite up for a Sunday lunch. </p>
<p>For a Sunday afternoon the bar area was pretty quiet. It is credit crunch time so I guess that is to be expected. We sat in the bar area which was comfortable and warm. There's an open fire place, which unfortunatley wasn't on, but would certainly help create a nice atmosphere if it was. We did expect the place to be a little more "oldie worldie" and cosy. So, although the place is nice enough it's not quite our cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating: 6</strong></p>
<h2 id="service"><a href="#service">Service</a></h2>
<p>The service was fine. The barman brought us our meal and was pleasant. The only gripe I have is that the White Horse do a 3 courses for £14.95 and we initially ordered a starter and a main but the kitchen closed as we were eating and we weren't informed so wouldn't have been able to order a dessert even if we had wanted one.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating: 6</strong></p>
<h2 id="presentation"><a href="#presentation">Presentation</a></h2>
<p>The roast came out on two plates. The main plate contained a single yorkshire pudding, some roast potatoes and two good slices of beef. A side plate also came out with a selection of vegatables; carrots, courgettes and mange tout. The picture below shows the main plate but has been partially disturbed - I was hungry :-) All in all the presentation was pretty good. The reason we've only given it a seven is that it was clear that the yorkshire pudding had dried out and the vegetables looked as if they were the last of the day and had been sitting for a while (sorry, no picture of the veg).</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_108" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="The White Horse, Sunday Beef Roast - partially devoured"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-108   " title="Sunday Beef Roast" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/photo0206-300x225.jpg" alt="Sunday Beef Roast" width="300" height="225" />[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Our rating: 7</strong></p>
<h2 id="taste"><a href="#taste">Taste</a></h2>
<p>We had a tomato soup for starters which was served with warm rolls. The soup was very tasty and had a nice kick to it. The main course wasn't quite as good. The White Horse finish serving at 15:00 and we arrived at 14:40 to make our order. With this in mind I can only assume that they cook everything early on and keep things warm during serving times. So, the yorkshire pudding  had dried out quite a bit, the beef was slightly overcooked, the veg had gone a bit soft. We were very happy with the roast potatoes :-)</p>
<p><strong>Our rating: 6</strong></p>
<h2 id="value"><a href="#value">Value</a></h2>
<p>Since we didn't get the 3 courses for £14.95 we were charged £12.95 each for the two courses.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating: 5</strong></p>
<h2 id="overall"><a href="#overall">Overall</a></h2>
<p>We might go back again, once we've tried a few other places, but we would definitely arrive earlier on in the serving. Hertingfordbury is a nice place, The White Horse is a nice enough place but the Sunday lunch itself didn't quite hit the mark.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating: 6</strong></p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/01/31/drag-drop-bug-in-jquery-ui-153.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2009/01/31/drag-drop-bug-in-jquery-ui-153.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="&lt;em&gt;jquery-ui-update---31/01/2009-@-17:15&lt;/em&gt;"><a href="#&lt;em&gt;jquery-ui-update---31/01/2009-@-17:15&lt;/em&gt;"><em>JQuery UI Update - 31/01/2009 @ 17:15</em></a></h3>
<p><a title="Richard D Worth" href="http://rdworth.org/blog/">Richard Worth</a> just got in touch with me via <a href="http://twitter.com/rworth">twitter</a> to let me know that JQuery UI 1.5.3 is only compatible with JQuery 1.2.6.</p>
<p><q cite="http://twitter.com/rworth/status/1164840041">The bug is not in jQuery UI 1.5.3, but just that 1.5.3 is only compatible with 1.2.6. Only 1.6rc5+ is compatible with jQuery 1.3</q></p>
<p>Therefore to use <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/index.html#jqueryUI">JQuery with JQuery UI from the Google Ajax Libraries</a> hosted service you need to do one of the following:</p>
<h4 id="script-includes"><a href="#script-includes">Script includes</a></h4>
<pre name="code" class="html">&lt;script type="text/javascript"
             src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
             src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.5.3/jquery-ui.jss"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<h4 id="google-library-loading"><a href="#google-library-loading">Google Library loading</a></h4>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">google.load("jquery", "1.2.6");
google.load("jqueryui", "1.5.3");</pre>
<p>---</p>
<p><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> seems to be the most active of the JavaScript libraries at the moment so I decided to use it for a little project. I've also decided to use the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/">Google AJAX Libraries APIs hosted service</a> to serve up the JavaScript files. At present <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/index.html#jqueryUI">Google is hosting JQuery UI</a> version 1.5.3. After a bit of investigation I've determined that there is a bug in the Drag  and Drop functionality in this version. It would appear that the "drop" function is not fired when you try to drop a draggable element on a droppable zone. I verified this by changing the JQuery UI version to the 1.6 RC that the <a href="http://ui.jquery.com/demos/droppable/">JQuery UI droppable demo</a> is using at the moment. When I did this the drag and drop functionality worked as expected.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" style="background-color:#5f5f5f;" title="JQuery UI" src="http://ui.jquery.com/images/logo.gif" alt="" width="235" height="55" /></p>
<p>This may be a know issue but I thought a small post on the matter might save other people a bit of time. I did have a look at raising a bug but there appears to be a bug in the <a href="http://dev.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=droppable">bug tracking system</a>.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2008/12/10/problem-solving-lessons-relearnt.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've had one of those days. I set out early this morning aware that I had a tough task ahead of me at work. By the end of the day I've made very little progress.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-75 alignnone" title="Thinking..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chimpanzee_thinking_poster-234x300.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="300" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> The silly thing is that I know exactly what mistakes I've made today that have hindered my progress and what's worse, I've made the same mistakes before.</p>
<p>&lt;h2 id=”&lt;a-id=”more”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a-id=”more-74”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;don’t-spend-too-long-in-front-of-the-computer”&gt;&lt;a href=”#&lt;a-id=”more”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a-id=”more-74”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;don’t-spend-too-long-in-front-of-the-computer”&gt;<a id="more"></a><a id="more-74"></a>Don’t spend too long in front of the computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>This might sound a bit daft since you are supposed to be programming and you can't do that unless you are in front of you computer. However, sometimes walking away from the computer for five minutes, and potentially taking your mind off your problem, can really help. Constantly thinking about the same thing can make you mind go stale. You need to freshen up, take some air, have a cup of tea or have a chat with somebody to take your mind off the problem just for a while. All of a sudden an alternative solution might pop into your head. This is just common sense.</p>
<p>My problem was one of threading, which can be tricky domain, and the mistake I made was that I thought the solution was so simple that I threw myself straight into code. After a couple of hours, and little progress, I took a step back and drew a simple diagram to make sure I understood the problem properly. Whilst the act of drawing the diagram didn't shed any light on this occasion it took my eyes off the screen for a moment and changed the way I was thinking about things. In addition, the diagram will be handy when I speak to others about the problem...</p>
<h2 id="do-ask-for-help"><a href="#do-ask-for-help">Do ask for help</a></h2>
<p>You can do this in a number of ways but the best way is to ask those around you. I'm lucky in that I work at a software house so there are loads of people that I can mosey on up to and chat with about a technical problem and even discuss some ins and outs of the technical detail. If you work on your own or don't work with others that have a similar technical mindset you can see out help and advice from forums, Twitter, email and instant messenger to name but a few. Don't wollow in the same problem for too long without looking for a fresh take on a problem. For me, this is one scenario where pair programming is really useful. By pairing on a problem you are less likely to run out of ideas because you will be constantly talking about the decisions you are making.</p>
<h2 id="don't-decide-it-needs-a-complete-re-write-at-6pm"><a href="#don't-decide-it-needs-a-complete-re-write-at-6pm">Don't decide it needs a complete re-write at 6pm</a></h2>
<p>This is exactly what I did today and I got myself into a right mood. What I generally mean is don't make big decisions or changes right at the end of the day. I didn't get out of work until around 8pm having only partially re-written the code I wanted to. Then, whilst sitting on the train having aired my brain a bit, I decided I didn't actually need to re-write everything. There are still alternative solutions that I've not tried out yet. There are still other reasons why tests might be failing. I've not discussed the problem with others who may come up with a better solution.</p>
<h2 id="do-learn-from-you-mistakes"><a href="#do-learn-from-you-mistakes">Do learn from you mistakes</a></h2>
<p>Today has been an example where it appears that I've not learnt from making similar mistakes in the past. But in actual fact I've probably corrected the mistakes a little quicker than I have previously so I have learnt, I just need to remind myself of these best practices more often. It's not like putting your finger on the tail of a wasp - you may do it once, but never again. The problems I've described here sneak up on you and before you know it you have spent three hours staring at the same area of code without making any progress. Maybe if I then went out and harrassed a wasp I would learn faster?</p>
<p>One of the great things about working in software engineering is that you have the opportunity to be learning nearly all the time. You don't just learn software engineering best practices but also common sense, problem solving best practices. Hopefully next time I'll only waste a fraction of a day before I realise the error of my ways.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I think that <a title="Live Mesh" href="http://www.mesh.com">Live Mesh</a> will be really useful. I think it provides great benefit to individual users, such as myself, and has great potential to be used by <a title="Independent Software Solutions" href="http://independentsoftwaresolutions.com">software solution developers</a>. I'm presently using it to synchronise some files that I want to backup and be available wherever I am.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/livemesh.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-64" title="Live Mesh" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/livemesh-300x214.png" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>I originally had a lot of web files being synchronised, around 700MB, but the synchronisation was taking ages and killing my CPU. CPU was sitting at 100% and there was no sign of things completing. I think it was having a problem with the volume of small files.</p>
<p>To summarise: it's a great product with bags of potential but something needs to be done to reduce the CPU usage when dealing with the synchronisation of a large volume of small files.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>To make a cross domain web request with SilverLight 2 really isn't that tough. I did have some problems with RC0 but I have no idea why. I just tried writing a little app to do this and it worked straight away.<br />

<p>Here's a <a href="http://dirhael.dcmembers.com/cnu/">link </a>to a very useful tool that'll download the latest <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> (well <a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/">Chromium</a>) nightly build. I decided to use this due to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4">vertical scrolling issue with Google Chrome</a> that was driving me mad. The bug was present in the release of Google Chrome but fixed in the nightly builds.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2008/06/25/colonsay-holiday-2008.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been back at work a week now after my holiday on <a title="Colonsay" href="http://www.colonsay.org.uk/">Colonsay</a> and I still think that I could have done with another week on this beautiful Scottish Isle.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31237.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-47" title="Jo and I on a hill on Colonsay" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31237-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-46"></a></p>
<h2 id="weather"><a href="#weather">Weather</a></h2>
<p>I've been to Colonsay for a holiday twice now and both times we've had great weather. I'm beginning to think that the weather there must be as good as the other popular destinations for British tourists.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31321.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-50" title="Jo at Kiloran Bay" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31321-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h2 id="where-to-stay"><a href="#where-to-stay">Where to stay</a></h2>
<p>We stayed in <a href="http://www.colonsay.org.uk/newother/chalets.html">chalets</a> owned by Kevin Byrne who also offers other self-catering accommodation. They have all the basic essentials for you holiday but the main thing that you are paying for is the location - right next to the hotel (and bar). There are plenty of other places to stay, including <a href="http://www.colonsay.org.uk/hotelghouse.html">B&amp;Bs</a> and <a href="http://www.colonsay.org.uk/otheracc.html">self-catering</a>, as it would appear that half the island own a second home to rent out to tourists.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31314.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-49" title="Me on one of the many beautiful beaches" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31314-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h2 id="cycling"><a href="#cycling">Cycling</a></h2>
<p>My girlfriend (Jo) and I hired bicycles whilst we were there from Archie MacConnell. The bicycles for hire aren't all that bad but if you want to do some serious cycling then it's probably a good idea to take your own across on the ferry.  It was a great way to see the sights and get a bit of exercise and there are quite a few hills so you certainly get plenty of the latter. In addition to cycling we did a bit of walking and climbing up hills to get great views of the whole isle.<br />
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31259.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-48" title="Colonsay Sunset" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/suc31259-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h2 id="food-and-drink"><a href="#food-and-drink">Food and Drink</a></h2>
<p>The isle has a post office and shop, a cafe (which I'd avoid unless you want scowled at by the folk that work there) and a hotel - The Colonsay Hotel. The hotel has a bar and restaurant. The bar and restaurant staff are nice and friendly and the food is really good although it is quite expensive. I guess this is due to the cost of running such a nice place in a remote location. We went for a meal in the restaurant on a Monday night and the food and service were excellent.</p>
<h2 id="the-people"><a href="#the-people">The People</a></h2>
<p>I'm not very well travelled but I'm quietly confident that Colonsay sees more friendly hand waving than any other place on the planet. You can't go 100 metres without somebody waving at you and saying "hiya!". It's a very friendly place. Alot of the time you wave and smile as you pass on the single-track road but even walking about you always get a smile and a wave whenever you pass somebody else.</p>
<p>I certainly hope to go back again.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I was awoken on the first day of my holiday to a clattering sound and my girlfriend exclaiming "I can't get the top drawer open".  I turned over and looked at the clock. It read 05:50! Something within the drawer has risen high enough so that when you try to open it it catches and the drawer can't open.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/droog_chest.jpg" title="Actually most the drawers in the image don't have the annoying cavity" alt="Actually most the drawers in the image don't have the annoying cavity" align="right" border="0" height="259" width="204" /></p>
<p>I then had to spend 30 minutes taking the whole set of drawers apart with a screwdriver to get this drawer open. I don't know how many times I've come across this same problem but still the design of drawers, and more to the point their casing, stays the same. The drawer cavity always has space above the actual drawer to allow things within the drawer to move into this space and then catch when you try and open the drawer.</p>
<p>My point here is that this has proven time and time again to be bad design with flaws yet this design does not change. The same problem can be seen in other engineering designs including software.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-45"></a></p>
<p>I've recently been working on a product which all in all has been a big success but there is one particularly ticky piece of code that is continuing to be troublesome. The interface to the section of code is well defined but the implementation continues to cause problems. The implementation was designed and has organically changed throughout the project and at various stages we've said that it could probably do with a redesign. However, it generally works without problems so we keep putting of the redesign. This is the same as the drawer design; you can open the same drawer 1,000 times without the contents catching but when it catches on the 1001<sup>st</sup> it's still very annoying.</p>
<p>I did a quick google for "<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=when+to+redesign+-website">when to redesign</a>" (ignoring "website" related posts) and came across a PDF on <a href="http://www.innovativethermal.com/Articles/Knowing%20When%20To%20Redesign%20A%20Product.PDF">Law 3 from the 10 laws of design and development</a> by <a href="http://www.innovativethermal.com/">Innovative Thermal Solutions</a>.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.innovativethermal.com/Articles/Knowing%20When%20To%20Redesign%20A%20Product.PDF"><p>It is usually difficult if not impossible to make the desired level of improvement without significant change to the original design. Everytime (yes, everytime!) I have been through this struggle, hindsight has shown that if we had bitten the bullet and made the significant design change called for at the first sign of a problem, the product cost and project schedule would have been better off.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact is that if something has a flaw which may require an overhaul in design then it should most probably be done. Something as simple as a drawer opening mechanism should work flawlessly. I'm not saying that software is as simple as this but the same design and redesign principles should be used across all forms of engineering.</p>
<p>If it works all the time and does everything you need then leave it alone. If it works most of the time then redesign and fix it - most of the time isn't good enough.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="liberator-fe"><a href="#liberator-fe">Liberator FE</a></h3>
<p>I work for <a href="http://www.caplin.com/">Caplin Systems</a> who have recently released <a href="http://www.freeliberator.com">Liberator FE</a> which is the Free Edition of their real time <a href="http://www.freeliberator.com/comet/">Comet</a> server product.</p>
<blockquote><p>Liberator is the most performant and fully-featured server currently available for streaming real-time data to web pages. The technology behind many of the world's leading financial trading portals, it is now available FREE for evaluation and non-commercial use.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this post I will detail my experiences when installing Liberator FE on Windows with an aim to being able to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application">RIA</a> Client that consumes data from a Capin <a href="http://www.freeliberator.com/documentation/DataSourceJava/javadoc/index.html">DataSource</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Liberator Free Edition comes with a comprehensive client library for integrating with Ajax or Flex, RIAs, a Java server library for connecting to sources of data and building application logic, and full documentation.</p></blockquote>

<a id="more"></a><a id="more-44"></a></p>
<h3 id="how-to-install-liberator-fe-on-windows"><a href="#how-to-install-liberator-fe-on-windows">How to Install Liberator FE on Windows</a></h3>
<p>Liberator FE will not run directly on Windows. The only way to acheive this in any way if you don't have a Linux server handy is to run it on a Virtual Machine. The following sections explain how to get the pieces of software that you need and how to install Liberator FE on Windows.</p>
<h4 id="vm-player"><a href="#vm-player">VM Player</a></h4>
<p>VMWare provide a free VMPlayer to allow you to run virtual machine images. Download it <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">here</a>. Alternatively you can use <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMServer</a>. Both are free to use but make sure you read through the licence agreement.</p>
<p>Installing the player is as simple as double clicking on the downloaded file and following the installation wizard.</p>
<h4 id="download-virtual-machine-image"><a href="#download-virtual-machine-image">Download Virtual Machine Image</a></h4>
<p>Once you have the player downloaded and installed you will need a Linux Virtual Machine image so that you can install Liberator FE.</p>
<p>There are a variety of places to get a VMWare image. I found a <a href="http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware/#centos5.1">Linux CentOS Image</a> via the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/appliances/">Virtual Appliance Marketplace</a>.</p>
<h4 id="run-the-virtual-machine-image"><a href="#run-the-virtual-machine-image">Run the Virtual Machine Image</a></h4>
<p>The VM Image will most probably be in a compressed archive so extract it. The image can the be opened using the VMPlayer by selecting the Open option and navigating to the directory with the VM Image and double clicking on the image file that will be visible.</p>
<p>There will most probably be some operating system setup steps to go through but using the Centos image that I chose this took less than 2 minutes.</p>
<p>At this point it's probably worth taking a note of the IP Address of the VM is for the Liberator FE registration. To do this enter <em>ifconfig eth0</em>. If that doesn't work you might need to enter the full path the the <em>/sbin/ifconfig eth0</em>.</p>
<h4 id="download-liberator-fe"><a href="#download-liberator-fe">Download Liberator FE</a></h4>
<p>Open up a web browser in the VMWare Player (Guest OS) and go to <a href="http://www.freeliberator.com">http://www.freeliberator.com</a>, fill in the details (remember to use the IP Address we got above) and download.</p>
<h4 id="install-liberator-fe"><a href="#install-liberator-fe">Install Liberator FE</a></h4>
<p>Move the downloaded Liberator FE installer to an install location and run the script which will install to a new <em>LiberatorFE</em> folder:<br />
<em>./LiberatorFE-4.4.12-1-i686-pc-linux-gnu.sh</em></p>
<p>When prompted enter the licence information that you used when you registered on <a href="http://www.freeliberator.com">http://www.freeliberator.com</a>. You will also be asked for port information. Since this is a clean OS install you should be able to use the default ports so just hit enter when prompted to choose ports. The default HTTP port is 8080 which we'll be using in our next step.</p>
<h4 id="start-the-liberator"><a href="#start-the-liberator">Start the Liberator</a></h4>
<p>Navigate to the <em>/LiberatorFE/etc/</em> directory and run <em>./rttpd start</em>.</p>
<p>To ensure that the Liberator has started up open up a web browser within the VM and navigate to <em>http://localhost:8080</em> (substitute 8080 for your HTTP port if you didn't choose the default. I chose 4040 just to be different). You should see the Liberator FE Status Page which means you have successfully installed Liberator FE on Windows.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just updated my Synaptics touchpad drivers and after a restart the scrolling no longer worked. I did the obvious, check the settings and "do a google" but could not find the solution anywhere. I then went back to the settings and then noticed a sub-settings option for the touchpad in the Device Settings tab. Select Synaptics TouchPad and then click the Settings...  button. A further properties dialog will appear with a Virtual Scrolling option. Select this option and then enable your scrolling.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently took a job back at <a href="http://www.caplin.com" title="Capin Systems - AJAX Trading Applications">Caplin Systems</a> in London and as a result have started commuting into the city every day by train. Once you've done the same journey a few times there's little new to see when looking out of the window so most people listen to music, read a book or read a newspaper. A newspaper doesn't generally take all that long to read - or generally only contains a few interesting articles - so people tend to leave their papers on the train when they alight. London has a plethora of free papers (<a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/">Metro</a>, <a href="http://www.thelondonlite.co.uk/">London Lite</a> and <a href="http://www.thelondonpaper.com/">The London Paper</a>) so people think nothing of leaving a free paper behind.</p>
<p>"National Express have teamed up with Metro Newspapers" blah, blah, blah. This is a new message that is announced at most stops to encourage passangers to take their papers with them and keep the train tidy. Never mind recycling. In all fairness the London station I get off at does have a "Newspaper recycling team" that are occasionally seen making their way through the trains to collect the discarded papers. The train station must have hundreds of trains through it a day and there is no way that this team will have time to collect all papers for recycling.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem would be to place newspaper bins or containers on each stations and encourange passangers to simply take their paper off the train with them and pop them in the newspaper bin on the platform. This is easier than having to take the paper to work or home with you and then recycling it. This would be a good idea for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) Most papers will end up in these paper containers and recycling teams can just collect from there at a given point in the day.</p>
<p>2) If you want a paper to read on the train you know exactly where you can get one from at each station.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that this isn't in place as I think that the green and useful sides of this idea make it a winner. Maybe there's something that I've not considered?</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/09/11/hpcompaq-nw9440-the-purchase-review-problems-and-solutions.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/09/11/hpcompaq-nw9440-the-purchase-review-problems-and-solutions.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In June 2006 I started working as a self employed software consultant. To mark this momentous occasion I decided to buy myself a shiny new laptop (<a href="/2007/05/22/linkstation-nas-folder-share-with-windows-vista.html">as mentioned in an earlier post</a>). After a reasonable amount of searching, including asking those I know who are knowledgeable about such things, I plumped for the <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/sm/WF06b/21675-283229-283229-283229-12434682-12401250-78003215.html">HP/Compaq nw9440</a>.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-31"></a>The nw9440 is a beast of a machine being a workstation replacement rather than a dedicated laptop. At the time of searching it was the highest spec'd machine that I could find. It boasts a 17 inch widescreen with 1920 by 1200 resolution which is the best I could do considering I'm used to a two monitors with a desktop PC. It comes with a 100GB 7200rpm hard disk, 2GB of memory, a 512MB Nvidia Quadro FX 1500M graphics card, DVD RW and is equipped with an Intel Centrino Duo 2 2.33GHz processor (do-do doo-doo).</p>
<p>I made the purchase direct from HP and the process wasn't quite as smooth as it should have been. I had to attempt to make the payment four times since it was declined on the first three occasions for a variety of administrative issues (I'm not dodgy - honest!).</p>
<p>When the payment was finally accepted I tried to get delivery on a Saturday as a way of HP saying "sorry" for the troubles I'd had so far. This didn't happen.</p>
<p>I finally got my laptop over a week after I first phoned up the sales desk to make my purchase.</p>
<p>At the time the nw9440 came with XP SP2 pre-installed and they didn't offer a Vista upgrade so I went and purchased the shiny new Windows Vista Ultimate to go with my shiny new laptop. Installation went smoothly and HP had all the drivers I needed available on their site. When all the drivers were installed I re-tested my Windows Experience Index (new to Vista) which gave me a 4.7 rating which was restricted by my 2GB of memory.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/windowsexperienceindex_hpnw9440.jpg" alt="HP nw9440 Windows Experience Index" /></p>
<p>However, there were a few teething issues. The HP Credential Manager software caused a variety of problems which led to the machine auto-shutting down when attempting to log into the machine. I eventually had to uninstall it leaving the finger print reader pretty useless. I've recently heard that this may be fixed but I reluctant to try it again.</p>
<p>The second software problem that I've had is the NVidia Quadro FX 1500M drivers cause a really horrible problem where the entire screen redraws over itself causing a really strange blurred/you-could-be-really-drunk effect. I read on various forums that there were problems with the 1500M drivers and that the best solution was to force install the 1500 drivers. This is done by trying to install them, which extracts the drivers to a directory, and then after the installation fails manually installing the driver for your graphics card from the Device Driver dialog.</p>
<p>Since I'm used to having two monitors when I'm not mobile I use a second monitor with my laptop. Unfortunately the nw9440 only comes with a VGA out and not a DVI which I just assumed would be on such a hi-spec machine. When using a second monitor I see interference on the external monitor, or any display, when the machine is under any sort of use. It's most noticeable when hard disk is being thrashed but can even be seen when wiggling the mouse around.</p>
<p>When I purchased my machine I also signed up for the HP Care Pack. I've now had the engineer out three times to look at this. I've had my system board and graphic card replaced but the issue is still there. I don't see the problem as much on my Samsung monitor at home but do see it on the DELL monitor that I'm using on my current contract. The Samsung monitor has around a 6 milli-second response time which may help negate the interference - but to be honest I don't really know. I have bought a docking station, which has DVI out, which I'm hoping will show no interference.</p>
<p>My experience with the HP Care Pack has been pretty good. The engineers seem knowledgeable and honest. When my graphics card was replaced, a 256MB replacement was sent out rather than the 512MB version and whereas some engineers may have just fitted it this engineer noticed the problem, highlighted it to me and sorted out getting the 512MB version. This did cause a week delay but this wasn't the engineer's fault.</p>
<p>Three months on from my purchase the nw9440 is performing pretty well despite the initial problems. It seems to cope with Vista's Aero UI although I've turned some of the features off; the fading in and out of the windows just gets on your nerves after a while. I normally have up to two an Eclipse IDE instances open, Outlook, Internet Explorer, Firefox, run a Virtual Machine and have a variety of other background processes running at the same time. There are a few problems with the VM causing the hard disk to be thrashed but I'm putting this down to problems with the VM.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Good all round specification</li>
<li>Great screen and resolution</li>
<li>Separate numerical keypad â€“ yep the nw9440 is that big</li>
<li>Easily handles Windows Vista</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia FX 1500M drivers are problematic</li>
<li>Only has a VGA port, no DVI, and interference when output from VGA</li>
<li>All inputs and outputs are on the side of the machine</li>
<li>HP Credential Manager software causes shutdown</li>
</ul>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/05/22/linkstation-nas-folder-share-with-windows-vista.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've just treated myself to a new laptop and one of the first things I found was that I couldn't access my NAS (Network Attached Storage) with windows explorer using <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fwindows%2Fproducts%2Fwindowsvista%2Feditions%2Fultimate%2Fdefault.mspx&amp;ei=h29TRpG2CIuiQaqFjb8J&amp;usg=AFrqEzezb3WTOY3v6MaN8kZI9E0Qu_7z6g&amp;sig2=Exz7HCiNeuFOlEnUzML5mw">Windows Vista Ultimate</a>. Vista could see the NAS on the network but whenever I tried to access it I would get prompted for a password. However, I have no password set for accessing to the NAS.</p>
<p><img src="http://linuxdevices.com/files/misc/buffalo_linkstation-thm.jpg" title="Linkstation" alt="Linkstation" align="middle" height="125" width="80" /> <strong>+ </strong><img src="http://img.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windows/images/products/windowsvista/editions/icon_vistaultimate.gif" title="Windows Vista Ultimate" alt="Windows Vista Ultimate" align="middle" height="185" width="138" /> <strong>= Why won't it work?</strong></p>
<p>So, after a bit of googling I came across a patch that updates a registry setting to allow Vista to navigate to network shares on the Linkstation NAS machine. I downloaded the <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/support/downloads/">patch for discontinued Linkstation</a> because that's the model I have. Patches are also available for other Linkstation versions via the <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/support/downloads/">Buffalo download page</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the best place for Buffalo downloads is the <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/support/downloads/">http://www.buffalotech.com/support/downloads/</a> url and NOT the http://www.buffalo-technology.com/support/downloads/ url. The first of the options seems to have more available; e.g. it has the patch for the Linkstation.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[.NET 2.0 Documentation Generation with Sandcastle]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/05/11/net-20-documentation-generation-with-sandcastle.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/05/11/net-20-documentation-generation-with-sandcastle.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been aware of Microsoft's documentation generation system called Sandcastle for a while now but only recently have I had a chance to use it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandcastledocs.com/Wiki%20Pages/Home.aspx" title="Microsoft Sandcastle"><img src="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB/Project/FileDownload.aspx?DownloadId=2696" title="Microsoft Sandcastle" alt="Microsoft Sandcastle" border="0" height="138" width="141" /></a></p>
<p>With <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> all but dead (see <a href="http://www.kynosarges.de/NDoc.html">NDoc 2.0 Alpha</a>) Sandcastle is now one of very few free alternatives that I could find to generate documentation from my coding comments. However, it did take a bit of searching and playing around to get things working.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-21"></a></p>
<p>You need the following core applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sandcastledocs.com">Microsoft Sandcastle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&amp;DisplayLang=en">HTML Help Workshop and Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've installed all three of these things you will need to ensure that each of your projects is creating XML Documents when then build. This can be done by viewing the properties of each of your projects in Visual Studio 2005 (right-click on the project and select "Properties", select "Build" and ensure the "XML Documentation file" checkbox is checked.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/xmlcheckbox.gif" alt="XML documentation file checkbox" /></p>
<p>Once you've ensured this checkbox is checked you'll need to build your solution so the XML documents are generated.</p>
<p>Now open the Sandcastle Help File Builder application and you should be able to select Project -&gt; New Project from Visual Studio Project...</p>
<p>Select and open up your Visual Studio solution and you should see the "Assemblies to Document" area filled with the project assemblies that belong to your solution. Now you need to populate the Build -&gt; Dependencies section with all the dependencies of your projects. You can add full folders, single files or GAC dependencies using the buttons at the bottom of the "Documentation Assembly Dependencies" dialog.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/add_dependencies.gif" alt="add dependencies" /></p>
<p>Finally update the Paths -&gt; HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath, Paths -&gt; SandcastlePath and Paths -&gt; OutputPath to the installation of the HTML Help Workshop location, Sandcastle location and your documentation output folder location respectively.</p>
<p>Click the build button or select Documentation -&gt; Build Project and your documentation should eventually be build in your selected OutputPath.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/03/29/england-goals.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With the reasonable success of <a href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com" title="Recall David Beckham to the England Squad">Bring Back Beckham!</a> I decided to push forward with my next project. The idea behind <a href="http://www.englandgoals.com" title="England Goals">England Goals</a> was to create a site that lists all the goals scored by the England football team and use the increase in the number of goals that can be found on external video sites to my advantage by embedding these user uploaded videos as content.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-18"></a></p>
<p>I've owned the <a href="#" style="text-decoration: line-through;">EnglandGoals.co.uk</a> and <a href="#" style="text-decoration: line-through;">EnglandGoals.com</a> domains for quite a while now and without having any real content on them the EnglandGoals.com site ranks towards the top of the most search engines for the term "england goals" [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=england+goals" title="Google search for England Goals">Google england goals</a> | <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=england+goals" title="Yahoo! search england goals">Yahoo! england goals</a> | <a href="http://search.msn.co.uk/results.aspx?q=england+goals" title="MSN search england goals">MSN england goals</a>].</p>
<p>The main problem now is getting content in the site so I need to try to encourage visitors to submit their favourite goals to the site rather than having to trawl <a href="http://www.youtube.com">You Tube</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</a> for the goals myself. I may need to incentivise this in some way. Maybe allowing the user who submits the goals to have a link to their own site next to their video submission. This way they will have the chance of users being driven to their site.</p>
<p>Why not visit <a href="#" style="text-decoration: line-through;" title="England Goals">England Goals</a> and let me know what you think?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in October 2006 I had an idea for a website. I tend to come up with a variety of ideas for things, most of which I add a .com to the end of. This time my idea was based around the fact that the England football team were in terrible form having drawn 0-0 with Macedonia and that Steve McClaren, the England manager, was refusing to pick England's, and the world's, most recognised footballer, David Beckham.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-16"></a></p>

<figure style="margin-bottom: 20px">
  <img src="/images/bring-back-beckham/bring-back-beckham-gainsborough-today.jpg" alt="Bring Back Beckham - The Mirror" width="600" />
</figure>

<p>McClaren's reasons, in my opinion, were not footballing ones. McClaren wanted to make an impact and stamp his authority on the England football team; what better way than to drop the previous captain! In addition he wanted to remove himself from the previous era under Sven-Goran Eriksson, where he was assistant, and therefore the dropping of Beckham was his was of saying that the failings of the team under Sven were not his fault but were more on Beckham's shoulders.</p>
<p>N.B. I think it's probably worth mentioning that I don't think that McClaren is a terrible manager. Nor do I think that he deserve to get any form of abuse, which occasionally turns up in the <a title="Bring Back Beckham! Your comments" href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com/comments/">Bring Back Beckham! Your comments</a> section of the site. I simply disagree with him dropping Beckham from the England squad as I feel he had no real reason to do so and that Beckham deserves a place in the squad at the least.</p>
<p>The idea behind the website was simple; get David Beckham recalled to the England squad. So, i quickly snapped up <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a title="Recall Beckham" href="#">http://www.recallbeckham.com</a></span> and started creating my website. The idea behind it was to get people to sign a kind-of-petition and leave comments stating that they wanted Beckham recalled to the England squad for the Euro 2008 qualifiers. On the way to watch the Croatia v England game in a pub (Wednesday October 11 2006)  my girlfriend commented that "Bring Back Beckham" was much catchier so I phoned my friend James who runs <a title="Frozen Web - Web Hosting, Domain Names, SSL Certificates" href="http://www.frozenweb.co.uk">FrozenWeb</a> and asked him to register <a title="Bring Back Beckham!" href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com">http://www.bringbackbeckham.com</a> for me. England went on to play terribly and lose 2 - 0.</p>
<p>I spent that night sprucing the site up and the next day, Thursday, I started getting a few hits. I also got an e-mail from a guy congratulating me on getting the <a title="Bring Back Beckham!" href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com">http://www.bringbackbeckham.com</a> domain and asking me what plans I had for it. As the website hits increased I started to realise that the site could really take off so I e-mailed <a title="The Sun Newspaper" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">The Sun newspaper</a> to ask them if they'd be interested in putting something on their site or in the newspaper about my site. Indeed I got a mention in both the Friday and Saturday editions of the paper and also on a couple of online articles:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006470853,00.html">Fans want David Beckham Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Calls for return of Goldenballs</span></a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to mentions in <a title="The Sun Newspaper" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">The Sun</a> I also got asked to do an <a title="Bring Back Beckham! interview with Talk Sport" href="#"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">interview with Talk Sport</span></a>, <a title="Bring Back Beckham! interview with BBC Radio Lincolnshire" href="#"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">interview with Radio Lincolnshire</span></a>, a discussion on Five Live, and mentions in various other articles in print and online including a <a title="Bring Back Beckham! in The Times" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-2403409,00.html">mention in The Times</a> and an <a title="Bring Back Beckham! Gainsborough Today" href="http://www.gainsboroughtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1198&amp;ArticleID=1830245">interview with Gainsborough Today</a> (I was born in Gainsborough).</p>

</figure>

<p>By Sunday October 15th 2006, 4 days after registering the website, the <a title="Bring Back Beckham!" href="http://www.bringbackbeckham.com">Bring Back Beckham! website</a> had been hit over 30,000 times.</p>
<p>Beckham has yet to win his deserved recall but was very close just recently when he was unfortunately injured. The site continues to get a reasonable amount of daily hits which spike whenever Beckham is in the news. However, I'm confident that Beckham's day will come and when he smacks home one of his trademark freekicks he'll pull the famous Three Lions over his head revealing a <a title="Bring Back Beckham! T-Shirt" href="http://www.spreadshirt.net/shop.php?op=article&amp;article_id=3776356">Bring Back Beckham! T-Shirt</a> in way of thanks to the campaign that helped him get his recall...okay, the T-Shirt thing won't happen but it would bring a smile to my face!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mapping APIs have been around for ages now and all the big guns (<a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/" title="Google Maps API">Google</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/" title="Yahoo Maps API">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/default.aspx?app=virtual_earth" title="Microsoft Virtual Earth API">Microsoft</a>) have thrown their hat into the ring.Â  You can even get a <a href="http://avi.alkalay.net/2006/11/google-maps-plugin-for-wordpress.html" title="Avi Alkalay - Google Maps Plugin for WordPress">Google maps plugin for wordpress</a> plugin to allow you to easily put a map in your blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Edinburgh&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=12&amp;ll=55.967842,-3.187408&amp;spn=0.066674,0.43396&amp;iwloc=addr" title="googlemap;w:425;nomarker">Wow, it's Edinburgh</a></p>
<p>There's even an <a href="http://www.mapstraction.com/" title="Mapstraction">API that allows you to switch between using all three</a> - but it doesn't look like it's been updated in quite a while.</p>
<p>All these examples exploded onto the scene but haven't really made any major advances, that my naked eye can see, for quite a while. Why is this? Is it that they are as good as they can possibly get? Or is development stagnant for another reason? Maybe it's lack of data! Whilst people are forever creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)" title="Wikipedia definition: Mashup">mashups</a> of this on top of that with a little bit of the other thrown in the unfortunate thing for me is that there hasn't really been anything that has blown my mind since the very early days of DHTML maps. Somebody please prove me wrong!</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for the <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/" title="Ordnance Survey â€“ Great Britain's national mapping agency">OS</a> to start setting the data free so that people can actually benefit from the high quality data without paying through the nose - then maybe we'll see some great UK mashups.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Whinge of the Week: Elephant.co.uk - bad experience]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/01/29/elephantcouk-bad-experience.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/01/29/elephantcouk-bad-experience.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_collision" title="Road Traffic Accident">RTA</a>. I've only once before been in a car accident but this time my car was quite badly damaged and the damage was judged to be "borderline". This means that the cost of fixing the car is in the same region as the car value. In this case a decision has to be made on whether the car will be fixed and this is done by "<em><strong><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> engineers</strong></em>" viewing the damage either via video link (yeah, right!) or, as I was told, digital images (much more likely). Once this has been done the insurance agency will make a decision on whether the car is <em><strong>written-off </strong></em>/<em><strong> a total loss</strong></em>. If it is <em><strong>written-off</strong></em> /<em><strong> a total loss</strong></em> then your car won't be fixed and the insurance agency will make you an offer for your car. So, in effect the insurance agency is buying the car off you.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-7"></a>The first of my gripes is that <a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> don't provide you with a courtesy car. The car is supplied by the garage that will be repairing your car, but only if the car is going to be repaired. It's therefore obviously that the speed at which a decision is made on the cars repair status has a direct relationship with the speed at which you will know if you will get a courtesy car. If the car is deemed <em><strong>written-off </strong></em>/<em><strong> a total loss</strong></em> you will need to organise a hire car.</p>
<p>It took the wonderful <a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> ten days (until 26th December 2006) to make a decision and the only reason it was done this quickly was because I kept phoning to chase things up. Maybe I forced them into scrapping my car?! Yep, it was Christmas and people would have been on holiday and things maybe weren't getting done as quickly as normal. But, YEP, it was Christmas and I needed a car to visit family. Anyway, by the time a decision was made it was all too late and I ended up having to make less than ideal alternative arrangements.</p>
<p>I had my accident on the Saturday 16th of December 2006. Today is the 29th of January 2007 and I have still not recieved a <em><strong>Total Loss Offer</strong></em> for my car from <a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a>. They are claiming that the paperwork is the hold-up however I have completed and returned any paperwork that they have requested from me within one day of receiving any request. The last letter I sent to them contained my vehicle registration documents and that was at the very beginning of January. Just over a week ago I was told that all the required paperwork was in place and I would have an offer by the end of the week. This week I have been told that the paperwork is just now in place and I will have an offer by the end of <em>this</em> week.</p>
<p>It's now fourty four days since my accident and I still don't have a car or any money to buy one with!</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth about <a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> do provide cheap car insurance</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> do answer the phones quickly</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> are moving call centres back to the U.K</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> will provide a courtesy car (via the garage) but only if your car is being repaired</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> will leave you without a car over Christmas</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> will take ages to make a decision on whether your car can be fixed or if it is a <em><strong>Total Loss</strong></em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> do take ages to get all the required paperwork in place following a claim and will most probably blame it on the <a href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk/" title="The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency are to blame!">DVLA</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> will leave you without a car or money to buy a new car for over fourty four days and counting</li>
</ul>
<p>The worst of it is that I'm sure that the <em><strong>Total Loss </strong></em>offer that <a href="http://www.elephant.co.uk" title="Elephant.co.uk car insurance">elephant.co.uk</a> will give me will be way below what it would cost for me to get the same make/model/extras and that I'll have to spend weeks proving the amount that my car was actually worth!</p>
<p>Whinge over!</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Update February 1st 2007:</p>
<p>I got a call from Elephant today, fourty seven days after my accident, with a <em><strong>Total Loss </strong></em>offer. It wasn't quite as much as I was hoping so I queried the amount and asked where they came up with it. It looks like they use <a href="http://www.autotrader.co.uk" title="Auto Trader - Used Cars">AutoTrader</a> to justify the offer along with some other standard price guide - fair enough really. After a few questions I found out that they had added an extra 20,000 miles onto my cars milage. The guy then had to go away and confirm that my milage was 20,000 miles less than he originally thought. He then upped the offer by Â£400.00. So, the offer in the end was reasonable and I could get a replacement car on <a href="http://www.autotrader.co.uk" title="Auto Trader - Used Cars">AutoTrader</a> for it so I accepted. I guess I could have haggled but I felt the offer was fair and that's all I ask.</p>

      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/01/25/xbox-360-power-supply-interfering-with-wifi.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2007/01/25/xbox-360-power-supply-interfering-with-wifi.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: My post on the XBox360 forum was removed - looks like they are trying to hide the fact that it really is a problem</strong></p>
<p>My fantastic girlfriend bought me an <a title="XBox 360 over on http://www.xbox.com" href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/hardware/xbox360/">XBox 360</a> for Christmas. I got a real bee in my bonet about a 360 ever since I saw the trailers and read the reviews for <a title="Gamespot - Gears of War" href="http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/gearsofwar/index.html">Gears of War</a>. I did consider hanging on for a PS3 but just could stop myself from dropping hints about a 360 for Christmas.</p>
<p>Anyhoooo, I do love my 360 but I've noticed that it badly interferes with my wireless network <em><strong>*</strong></em>. So, I've made a <a title="XBox 360 forum post" href="http://forums.xbox.com/9898711/ShowPost.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">post about the power supply causing wireless interference</span></a> over on the XBox forums to see if anybody else has had a similar problem. I'd really like confirmation that it is the <a title="Link to picture of the XBox 360 power supply" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2005/10/17/is-that-the-xbox-360s-a-c-adapter/">massive power supply</a> that's the issue.</p>
<p>Oh, and I've also already had to have the hard disk replaced because it was corrupt. I just ain't the luckiest!</p>
<p><em><strong>*</strong></em> Setting up the network in the first place certainly wasn't a piece of cake. I'm not using the MIMO technology that I actually bought all the Netgear products for because with the <strong>Auto 108 </strong>option set in the router config the CPUs on both my desktop and laptop go crazy. This is obvoiusly something to do with the netgear drivers but after hours of messing I finally had to set the router to Channel 7 and G-only to get a steady connection that didn't fry the CPUs of my machines.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[A Career Using JavaScript]]></title>
      <link>https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2005/06/30/a-career-using-javascript.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2005/06/30/a-career-using-javascript.html</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Since most of the hits to my site will probably be following a search for either "Leggetter" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>" I thought that I had best post something about the latter of these topics.</p>
<p>My knowledge of <strong>JavaScript</strong> has been gained by working for companies that have used Web Technologies in their products. My first job was in London back in 2001 and at this time I would guess that <strong>JavaScript</strong> would not have been classed as a mainstream programming language. I guess that many would still not think of it as mainstream but it certainly has become more prominent with the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>. Its common uses back in 2001 would have been to create rollover effects or dynamically write page content on the client-side <strong>using</strong><code>document.write</code>. However, the company that I worked for used it as a main language to develop a product to deliver real-time financial data in a browser to the PC desktop. So, over my two years at this company my knowledge of this language grew considerably.</p>
<p>As well as <strong>using</strong> <strong>JavaScript</strong> to develop my employers products I used it in developing my own small web applications, web sites and small to medium bits of functionality for friends sites or web applications. I also used to contribute to "comp.lang.<strong>javascript</strong>" and a few forums but as the popularity of the language increased as did the number of people who wanted to ask and solve <strong>JavaScript</strong> questions. Also, as the number of <strong>JavaScript</strong> users increased the number of simply solved questions were asked. It became a challange in itself to find that challanging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHTML">DHTML</a>/<strong>JavaScript</strong> question. With the <strong>JavaScript</strong> community getting so crowded I decided to leave the newsgroups and forums to those with a bit more spare time.</p>
<p>Even though I had decided to leave the forums alone it did not mean that I left <strong>JavaScript</strong>alone. Indeed I made a move north to Scotland to work for a small company that used <strong>JavaScript</strong> and DHTML to deliver simulations of a variety of real life applications. These simulation ran purely in a browser and used a very clever combination of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, HTML, DTHML and Java to deliver high quality simulation products to large financial service companies. Whilst at this company my knowledge of cross-browser compatibility issues increased considerably.</p>
<p>Two years on I made the decision to make a move to a company that did not use <strong>JavaScript</strong> as its primary development language. At the very same time as I had made my decision to move on the idea of AJAX came about and <strong>JavaScript</strong> took another leap in popularity. Whether or not its popularity will mean that my current company come up with more ideas on how to use <strong>JavaScript</strong> in the same guise as Google Maps is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>So, what is the point in this post? Well, I suppose it has turned into a mini <strong>career</strong> biography and also has proven that a <strong>career</strong> in Software Engineering can be acheived <strong>using</strong> <strong>JavaScript </strong>as a primary language - although it has to be said that I was quite lucky that my first two companies were so specialised in its use. I guess the point is also to highlight that I'm very experienced in the use of this language so if anybody has any questions about a piece of <strong>JavaScript</strong> code, a "How To" question or a piece of contract work that they need an experienced <strong>JavaScript</strong>/DHTML developer to take on they should get in touch with me.</p>
<p>A final note that I would like to make is that during my <strong>career</strong> I have gained experience in a variety of other languages as well as general software engineering skills. The languages that I now consider myself very capable of <strong>using</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
<li>DHTML</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>VBScript</li>
</ul>
